##### [Vault Door 4](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/71?difficulty=2&page=13&solved=1)
Medium
Reverse Engineering
Desc: This vault uses ASCII encoding for the password. The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor4.java](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/834acd392e0964a41f05790655a994b9/VaultDoor4.java)

Steps:
1) Looking at the source code I see this block:
```java
byte[] myBytes = {
	106 , 85  , 53  , 116 , 95  , 52  , 95  , 98  ,
	0x55, 0x6e, 0x43, 0x68, 0x5f, 0x30, 0x66, 0x5f,
	0142, 0131, 0164, 063 , 0163, 0137, 0146, 064 ,
	'a' , '8' , 'c' , 'd' , '8' , 'f' , '7' , 'e' ,
};
```
This is a series of different encodings of ascii character.
2) Using an encoding to ascii translator I will translate each line, decimal, hex, octal are the encodings.
	1) jU5t_4_b
	2) UnCh_0f_
	3) bYt3s_f4
Summary:
	The data was encoded with decimal, hex and octal in order to hide the flag. Using CyberChef I was able to translate the values however I found out that rapidtables was unreliable, for some reason it would not properly translate the decimal to ascii. The others worked fine but I will go back to using cyberchef.

##### [Vault Door 5]()
Medium 
Reverse Engineering
Desc: In the last challenge, you mastered octal (base 8), decimal (base 10), and hexadecimal (base 16) numbers, but this vault door uses a different change of base as well as URL encoding! The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor5.java](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/d31ce4356bdfd15d33a9af7e35ab4d0a/VaultDoor5.java)

Steps: 
1) Opening the source code I see, a comment also mentions that the text is converted to URL encoding.
```java
        String expected = "JTYzJTMwJTZlJTc2JTMzJTcyJTc0JTMxJTZlJTY3JTVm"
                        + "JTY2JTcyJTMwJTZkJTVmJTYyJTYxJTM1JTY1JTVmJTM2"
                        + "JTM0JTVmJTY1JTMzJTMxJTM1JTMyJTYyJTY2JTM0";

```
2) Using CyberChef I used the recipe FromBase64 -> URL Decode

Summary:
	The flag was hidden under two layers of encoding, Base64 and URL Encoding. Using CyberChef I was able to make a recipe to decode it to reveal the flag. 

##### [Echo Valley](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/485?page=1&solved=1)
Medium
Binary Exploitation
Desc: The echo valley is a simple function that echoes back whatever you say to it. But how do you make it respond with something more interesting, like a flag? Download the source: [valley.c](https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_shape_facility/3540df5468ae2357d00a7a3e2d396e6522b24f7a363cbaff8badcb270d186bda/valley.c) Download the binary: [valley](https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_shape_facility/3540df5468ae2357d00a7a3e2d396e6522b24f7a363cbaff8badcb270d186bda/valley)

Steps:
1) Looking at the source code I see a `print_flag` function but nothing that calls it. This leads me to think I need to find a part to abuse.
	- `echo_valley` method uses fgets to assign the user input, so I will do research to see if that is potentially vulnerable. 
	- The hint mentions [format string attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack) so I will try these.
