Personal Project:

Continuation of GoogleAuth learning.

Following this guide: https://permify.co/post/implement-oauth-2-golang-app/

I was confused about what the flow for authentication was, but I believe that it is as simple as:
Login -> Create Token -> Send Token to Client -> Save Token in Client -> Check if token is valid -> 1. If invalid log out 2. if valid send to authenticated API -> Check token on Server -> 1. Respond with 2XX if valid 2. Respond with 403 if Invalid/Redirect to login.

Another guide that seems more Go/React specific.

Another thing to look at. Maybe I just work on the rest of the application like adding and removing and then I can create the user later.
