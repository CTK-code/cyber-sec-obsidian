Personal Project:

Added a route that gets a CV by cv_id
I need to figure out how to authenticate and log in a user so that I can use them to get their CVs and data from their CV.

I have now assigned a name to my remote machine in my MacOS, it can now be accessed at `chris@dev-box` instead of using the whole ip. This should be good now since the ip is now static instead of dynamic.

I have started the process of learning about how to implement oauth for the backend.
I am confused about how it gets verified on the front end, but I assume it means that we are going to call the auth route on every page before we do anything, it might be a wrapper around my other routes but I do not fully understand how it should be implemented, but perhaps doing it poorly and then fixing it is better than spending all of my time researching.

PicoCTF:

##### [Bitlocker-1](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/453?page=2&solved=1)
Medium
Forensics
Desc: Jacky is not very knowledgable about the best security passwords and used a simple password to encrypt their BitLocker drive. See if you can break through the encryption!
Hypothesis: I have to look through the file system to find a file of password that are weakly encrypted with something very simple.



Steps:


pwn.college:

I want to try pwn.college to see if it has a different approach than PicoCTF. It seems to have a lot more lectures and I think that would be better for me to learn rather than tossing me into the challenges in PicoCTF as not knowing what I don't know is my current struggle.

pwn.college lets me go through either a terminal or through a web gui which is nice, it means I most likely won't need to download challenges at the start.

In practice mode, there is no password for root.

Path Traversal 1:
I knew that I need to find a way to read files in the file system but using '../' did not work, another way to traverse is by using url encoding. The equivalent of `../` is `%2e%2e%2f` and that lets me traverse routes. 
using it twice got me to the root directory and the server was able to read the flag file that I did not have permissions for.




Daily Summary:

When passing parameters into a http route, using url encoding for none alphanumeric characters may be required.
