Can you login to this website?
Steps:
1) Given a generic login page I can open this is burp suite and make a login request.
	- The website shows the SQL query that it uses so I will try to do simple injections. 
	- Burpsuite shows that there is a debug flag in the request set to 0 so I will try to set that to a non-zero value.
```sql  
username: admin
password: admin
SQL query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='admin'
```
