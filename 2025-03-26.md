This problem gives me a flag as well as a python file and I have to figure out how the flag was encoded.

I assume that I have to reverse engineer the b16 encode function
So it looks like the combination of the binary\[:4] + binary\[:4] will be the whole binary value

I will just write a script that does the complete opposite of the methods in the new_caesar.py.

I wrote a program that allows for the decoding of this specific cypher. Its quite involved but simple. 

I had to learn about concatenating two binary numbers which I have never done before then translating those numbers into decimal and finally into characters. All of this is the last step, before this I have to figure out how to shift the characters over which seems harder since it uses enumerate which I dont think I have used before.


Clearly this was a slow day, I think there is a very small desire from me to work on programming recently and I need to refind my motivation. Part of it I think is that I am writing so much that it takes away from the joy that I usually get from just learning on my own, it feels likes Im working someone else's pace. I think I am learning better this way but it doesnt mean that I am having as much fun.
