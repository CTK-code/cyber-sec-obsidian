Desc: Can you find the flag? [shark1.pcapng](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/b44842413a0834f4a3619e5f5e629d05/shark1.pcapng).
Given a pcapng I have to look at the contents through [[Wireshark]] and see what there is that I can find.

I figure looking at post requests might be good so I used this filter to look just at the post requests
`!(arp or stp or lldp or cdp) and http.request.method == "POST"`


Personal Projects:

Today I mostly spent time working on personal projects instead of PicoCTF. 
Today I have implemented a rudimentary nav bar with no styling so far in order to swap between the main page and the cv page.

The CV now has a container for it but it isn't doing anything. It matches the size of a paper.

I ran into an issue where my css was not properly being applied (twice).
I have a bad habit of not connecting my css files to my jsx, the first time it was just because of that and the second time it was because I was trying to apply my css to ids instead of classes.
