Desc: Can you find the flag? [shark1.pcapng](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/b44842413a0834f4a3619e5f5e629d05/shark1.pcapng).
Given a pcapng I have to look at the contents through [[Wireshark]] and see what there is that I can find.

I figure looking at post requests might be good so I used this filter to look just at the post requests
`!(arp or stp or lldp or cdp) and http.request.method == "POST"`

Using wireshark  we can go into statistics and see what the breakdown of the protocols used are.

Since we can see that there are text-based packets we can apply the filter for them straight from there and then that will reveal the flag.

The flag is encoded in some way, maybe a caesar cypher, but it's there.

cvpbPGS{c33xno00_1_f33_h_qrnqorrs}
It was a caesar cypher in the end. The reason I thought that initially was because I saw that the picoCTF part of the flag was properly capitalized and so I assumed that if I cycled through the options Id be able to find it.

This problem was difficult since I had no idea what to look for in wireshark. Now that I know that I can look at the different protocols I can start there, but without a guide there would be no way for me to have known that. 

Personal Projects:

Today I mostly spent time working on personal projects instead of PicoCTF. 
Today I have implemented a rudimentary nav bar with no styling so far in order to swap between the main page and the cv page.

The CV now has a container for it but it isn't doing anything. It matches the size of a paper.

I ran into an issue where my css was not properly being applied (twice).
I have a bad habit of not connecting my css files to my jsx, the first time it was just because of that and the second time it was because I was trying to apply my css to ids instead of classes.
