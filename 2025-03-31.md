### PicoCTF

Desc:A developer has added profile picture upload functionality to a website. However, the implementation is flawed, and it presents an opportunity for you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate to the provided web page and locate the file upload area. Your ultimate goal is to find the hidden flag located in the /root directory.
Hypothesis: There is going to be a way to execute code in the file input.

There's is a form to upload an image and it updates the image. 
The confirmation page shows that it uses php for the upload (I think)

This one is having me download BurpSuite so I think I should move to a Burp Suite intro and then come back to this one later.

Web Exploitation

So using Burp Suite I have to look at the requests/responses and try to figure out where the flag is. The hints say that I should try mangling the request to see if it handles malformed inputs well

I tried sending `<? eval($_GET['cmd']); ?>` to see if I could access a cmdline somehow but no luck, the input was sanitized well enough.
To a write up I think. Not knowing the extent to how I can mangle a request is the current limitation.

OTP is supposed to be numeric and this OTP doesnt seem to check that it isn't just numbers. Perhaps a little injection?

I just removed the otp parameter and it spat out the flag.
