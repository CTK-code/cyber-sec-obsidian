### PicoCTF

Desc:A developer has added profile picture upload functionality to a website. However, the implementation is flawed, and it presents an opportunity for you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate to the provided web page and locate the file upload area. Your ultimate goal is to find the hidden flag located in the /root directory.
Hypothesis: There is going to be a way to execute code in the file input.

There's is a form to upload an image and it updates the image. 
The confirmation page shows that it uses php for the upload (I think)

This one is having me download BurpSuite so I think I should move to a Burp Suite intro and then come back to this one later.

Web Exploitation

So using Burp Suite I have to look at the requests/responses and try to figure out where the flag is. The hints say that I should try mangling the request to see if it handles malformed inputs well

I tried sending `<? eval($_GET['cmd']); ?>` to see if I could access a cmdline somehow but no luck, the input was sanitized well enough.
To a write up I think. Not knowing the extent to how I can mangle a request is the current limitation.

OTP is supposed to be numeric and this OTP doesnt seem to check that it isn't just numbers. Perhaps a little injection?

I just removed the otp parameter and it spat out the flag.

At this point the primer is a lot of reading that I cannot pay attention to for the life of me, I'd much rather learn by doing.

Description:Files can always be changed in a secret way. Can you find the flag?

Given a `cat.png` I have to try and figure out how to get the flag.

Start by checking the file to see if theres anything interesting.
```bash
file cat.jpg
cat.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.02, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, baseline, precision 8, 2560x1598, components 3
```
I tried using `chmod -x cat.jpg` to see if I could run something in there but no dice.

I want to look into the metadata so I saw that there is a tool to look at it called exif
Exif didn't reveal anything to me.

I found out (by looking at a solution) that we are able to hexdump the image and search through it.

I was not able to find anything but apparently I should be looking at the license since it is different than a real license.

So I was able to look at the license with exiftool and then decode it from base64.
I used the command ` echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9 | base64 -d`

The license should not have passed the sniff test, I had tried it in that format but didnt think about decoding it.

Started by seeing what the file is.
```bash
file garden.jpg
garden.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.01, resolution (DPI), density 72x72, segment length 16, baseline, precision 8, 2999x2249, components 3
```
Using `exiftool garden.jpg` didnt reveal anything either.

`hd garden.jpg` (shorted hexdump -C) revealed the flag was in the hexdump.

Desc:

I have already completed this one but it would be good to see if I remember how to do it. So much of memorization is just drilling into your mind.

The name Enhance makes me think of actually looking at the image, so I'll do that first.
Ahh this one is the svg. I think that SVGs are actually code that defines an image so Ill look through that code.
It was out there in plain text so nice and simple.

We don't want to work with the original file in case we accidentally modify the file in an irreversible way.
(I feel like I probably won't be doing that since I can just redownload from pico)
`dd` can be used to copy files.

`lsbkl` shows us our disks

Disk Image later
Multimedia Layer:
Shows the data and how it's split

Block Layer:

Journal Layer:
Incremental Backup and to recover quickly

Metadata Layer:
All about inodes. Permissions, ownership timestamps, blocks

Filename Layer:
Highest layer with the file names

Sleuthkit lets you traverse all layers

Each layer has these commands with a different prefix
mmstat
mmls
mmcat

Additionally:
blkcalc
ifind - find inode based on filename or block number
ffind - find filename based on it's inode

Desc: This is a really weird text file TXT? Can you find the flag?
Hypothesis: Ill have to inspect the file in a weird way to figure out what the flag is. I will start with looking at the hexdump

using the file command I find out that this is actually a png and not a text file. Ill try to open the file on my main computer

All I had to do was open the image since it wasn't really text. To do this I moved it onto my computer and changed the filename
`mv flag.txt flag.png` and then my computer tried to open it as a png instead of as text.

Desc: Download this image and find the flag.

Start with `file pico.flag.ctf` shows me that it is a small png
I'll open the picture to see if it reveals anything, all it is is the pico logo
I'll hexdump the contents to see if theres a flag in the hexcode somewhere
$t3g0 is a tool written in python that I will install and poke around with

When using the stego tool, I was trying to figure out the password since it prompted me for one. The password was $t3g0 but I only guessed that because of the hint I was given. I will look at a write up to see if there was a way to find it programatically.

Apparently a program called `zsteg` can be used for this and when looked at in `zsteg` the answer is in plain text

Desc: There's something in the building. Can you retrieve the flag?
Editor's Note: The building is a png and does not mean plan.

`file building.png` reveals that it is a relatively small png. Ill try opening the picture normally
