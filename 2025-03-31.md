### PicoCTF

Desc:A developer has added profile picture upload functionality to a website. However, the implementation is flawed, and it presents an opportunity for you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate to the provided web page and locate the file upload area. Your ultimate goal is to find the hidden flag located in the /root directory.
Hypothesis: There is going to be a way to execute code in the file input.

There's is a form to upload an image and it updates the image. 
The confirmation page shows that it uses php for the upload (I think)

This one is having me download BurpSuite so I think I should move to a Burp Suite intro and then come back to this one later.

Web Exploitation

So using Burp Suite I have to look at the requests/responses and try to figure out where the flag is. The hints say that I should try mangling the request to see if it handles malformed inputs well

I tried sending `<? eval($_GET['cmd']); ?>` to see if I could access a cmdline somehow but no luck, the input was sanitized well enough.
To a write up I think. Not knowing the extent to how I can mangle a request is the current limitation.

OTP is supposed to be numeric and this OTP doesnt seem to check that it isn't just numbers. Perhaps a little injection?

I just removed the otp parameter and it spat out the flag.

At this point the primer is a lot of reading that I cannot pay attention to for the life of me, I'd much rather learn by doing.

Forensics
Description:Files can always be changed in a secret way. Can you find the flag?

Given a `cat.png` I have to try and figure out how to get the flag.

Start by checking the file to see if theres anything interesting.
```bash
file cat.jpg
cat.jpg: JPEG image data, JFIF standard 1.02, aspect ratio, density 1x1, segment length 16, baseline, precision 8, 2560x1598, components 3
```
I tried using `chmod -x cat.jpg` to see if I could run something in there but no dice.

I want to look into the metadata so I saw that there is a tool to look at it called exif
Exif didn't reveal anything to me.

I found out (by looking at a solution) that we are able to hexdump the image and search through it.

I was not able to find anything but apparently I should be looking at the license since it is different than a real license.

So I was able to look at the license with exiftool and then decode it from base64.
I used the command ` echo cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9 | base64 -d`

The license should not have passed the sniff test, I had tried it in that format but didnt think about decoding it.
