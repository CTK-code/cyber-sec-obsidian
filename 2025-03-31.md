Desc:A developer has added profile picture upload functionality to a website. However, the implementation is flawed, and it presents an opportunity for you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate to the provided web page and locate the file upload area. Your ultimate goal is to find the hidden flag located in the /root directory.
Hypothesis: There is going to be a way to execute code in the file input.

There's is a form to upload an image and it updates the image. 
The confirmation page shows that it uses php for the upload (I think)
