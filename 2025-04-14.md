Desc: We found this [packet capture](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/483e50268fe7e015c49caf51a69063d0/capture.pcap). Recover the flag.

Looking at the pcap I am unsure how to start since there is so much information. The hint says to look for streams, streams are either TCP or UDP so I can filter for those.

While going through the packets I see consecutive packets that include `p i c o` in the same position so I then filtered to only include that source and destination.

Going through the packet lets me see that it is most likely the flag and the I will get all those characters at that position
`picoCTF{N0t_a_fLag}`

Well that was cruel.
There is another stream with a different destination but the same source so I will filter for that since it also has `picoCTF` in the same position

This John Hammond [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm6do94cvEY) shows us how to do this in python instead of just by doing it manually.
