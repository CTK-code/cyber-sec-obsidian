Desc: We found this [packet capture](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/483e50268fe7e015c49caf51a69063d0/capture.pcap). Recover the flag.

Looking at the pcap I am unsure how to start since there is so much information. The hint says to look for streams, streams are either TCP or UDP so I can filter for those.

While going through the packets I see consecutive packets that include `p i c o` in the same position so I then filtered to only include that source and destination.

Going through the packet lets me see that it is most likely the flag and the I will get all those characters at that position
`picoCTF{N0t_a_fLag}`

Well that was cruel.
There is another stream with a different destination but the same source so I will filter for that since it also has `picoCTF` in the same position

`picoCTF{StaT31355_636f6e6e}`
This John Hammond [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sm6do94cvEY) shows us how to do this in python instead of just by doing it manually.

I looked up Square flag blue border white center and found that it is the maritime signal flags to spell out messages.

Desc: Theres tapping coming in from the wires. What's it saying `nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 48247`

I assume that it's going to be morse code which sounds miserable.

Never mind they didnt make me listen to the code.

Desc: We found this [packet capture](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/b506393b6f9d53b94011df000c534759/capture.pcap). Recover the flag that was pilfered from the network.

Hypothesis: It will be a post request since it says that it was pilfered which means they got access to the whole flag somehow.

I can see that there is another similar packet situation as the previous [shark on wire][[2025-04-14#[shark on wire 1]] 
This time I will try using the tools that John Hammond did and write a script to do it. 

Using [scapy](https://scapy.net/) I can read the manipulate the packets.
