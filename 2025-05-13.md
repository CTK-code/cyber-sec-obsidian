Personal Project:
I am having an issue updating the documents. This is a correct (at least doesn't throw exceptions) version of my update statement.

```go
update := bson.D{
	{Key: "$set", Value: bson.D{
		{Key: "session_token", Value: sessionToken},
	}},
}
```

However it was giving me issues before. I went to undo to my original code and it was exactly this. So I have no idea what Im meant to be doing about it.

The issue appears to be that I should have been using bson.M instead of bson.D in order to access the database.

This ends up being the correct solution so there are no bson.D which I do not know why it would not work, plenty of online solutions used that.

```go
func (cfg *Config) updateSessionToken(sessionToken string, ctx context.Context, email string) error {
	filter := bson.M{"email": email}
	update := bson.M{
		"$set": bson.M{"sessiontoken": sessionToken},
	}

	_, err := cfg.DBConn.Collection("users").UpdateOne(ctx, filter, update)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	return nil
}
```
