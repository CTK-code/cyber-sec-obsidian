Personal Project:
I am having an issue updating the documents. This is a correct (at least doesn't throw exceptions) version of my update statement.

```go
update := bson.D{
	{Key: "$set", Value: bson.D{
		{Key: "session_token", Value: sessionToken},
	}},
}
```

However it was giving me issues before. I went to undo to my original code and it was exactly this. So I have no idea what Im meant to be doing about it.
