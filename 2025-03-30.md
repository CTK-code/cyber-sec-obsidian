#### Personal Project

Exporting my functions was being annoying because I was not doing it properly. I thought I could just `export function <name>`
but I had to `export default <function-name>` after the definition.

json objects in javascript are defined as follows:
```javascript
{
	'name': 'Chris',
	'age': 'old'
}
```

I was struggling through having my json object pass to my child components. Turns out I just needed to surround the parameter in {} to destructure it (I think).


So far I have added and styled the individual job experience details.

My guy, you have to someday remember that your css doesnt apply if you dont IMPORT IT

Progress for today:

- Added the work experience section
- Added a generic header
- Started on the projects section.

Todo Tomorrow:
- Finish the porjects section
- Start summary
- Start Main header
- Start Main Sub Header
- Start Skills Section

### PicoCTF

Back to reading the primer.
Now it's talking about XSS (cross site scripting) and to me this starts to really feel like the hackery kinda stuff that look so cool and sounds so cool.
