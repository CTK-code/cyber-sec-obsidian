Exporting my functions was being annoying because I was not doing it properly. I thought I could just `export function <name>`
but I had to `export default <function-name>` after the definition.

json objects in javascript are defined as follows:
```javascript
{
	'name': 'Chris',
	'age': 'old'
}
```

I was struggling through having my json object pass to my child components. Turns out I just needed to surround the parameter in {} to destructure it (I think).
