Still sick, will try to get some work done.

### PicoCTF: 

### Personal Project:

I am having a lot of trouble figuring out how to get my React app to properly consume the JSON coming from my GO server.

So I am trying to have my React app proxy to my go server but for some reason it would not work.

It turns out that I was doing it in the React way and not the Vite way. So instead I had to go into my vite.config.js and add a server proxy there.

```javascript
// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api' : 'http://localhost:8888'
    }
  }
})
```

Had to change Education to iterate to create all the educations and pass a list. Makes me think I dont need all the files for the other section vs individual component. May want to refactor that later.
