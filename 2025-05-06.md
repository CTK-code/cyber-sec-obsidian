Personal Project:

After way too much research and not understanding things, I used ChatGPT to explain what the flow should be and it is recommending that it is all handled on the backend.  I feel guilty for using ChatGPT but I exhausted all the resources (except asking another person) for help.

For this I will be using the goth package since I am struggling with the general authentication process. I may also want to include the option to create an account using email/password.

My only goal for today is to get some form of auth working at all. Hopefully.

Had an issue with the client with an issue that the client_id didn't exist when I was trying to login. This was because I was not setting up godotenv properly so it was grabbing blank values. 

In the future I hope that I can just have that setup in an init and hope that works for the whole application.

Issue:
redirect_uri_mismatch
Caused by using a query parametery as the target for the redirect since I am unable to do it with just a route parameter since I am using vanilla html.
