Goal: Look through the mmls to see what the image contains and find the flag (somehow)
Hypothesis: ???

```bash
mmls disk.flag.img
DOS Partition Table
Offset Sector: 0
Units are in 512-byte sectors

      Slot      Start        End          Length       Description
000:  Meta      0000000000   0000000000   0000000001   Primary Table (#0)
001:  -------   0000000000   0000002047   0000002048   Unallocated
002:  000:000   0000002048   0000206847   0000204800   Linux (0x83)
003:  000:001   0000206848   0000360447   0000153600   Linux Swap / Solaris x86 (0x82)
004:  000:002   0000360448   0000614399   0000253952   Linux (0x83)
```

So... I have no idea what the flag is supposed to be? 

I decided to look more into SleuthKit using this [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R-IE2j04Chc) to try and figure out what SleuthKit is capable of.

Lots of good information.

Using fls and an offset recursively piped into grep shows me that there is a flag.txt
```
fls -r -o 360448  disk.flag.img | grep flag
++ r/r * 2082(realloc):	flag.txt
++ r/r 2371:	flag.uni.txt
```

Looking up icat I can see the contents of the images
```
icat -o 360448  disk.flag.img 2371
picoCTF{by73_5urf3r_2f22df38}
```

Easy! Turns out I will have to do a lot of reading/looking at resources to figure out what I can even do with tools.

Back to the Primer!
Actually we will watch a John Hammond vid about the last challenge and just write down the steps that he takes.
He actually has a whole directory to hold all the challenges
Honestly this all seems like it takes longer than doing it via the cli but watching this makes me feel better because it's not always obvious even to experts.

1. file
2. gunzip
3. ls -lah (human readable size)
4. strings | grep pico
5. He tries using autopsy to look through the image
6. opens the autopsy webgui
7. He defines the case
8. realpath to get the absolute path of a file
9. I stopped writing.
