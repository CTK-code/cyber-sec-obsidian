A long break for documenting what I have been working on.

##### Personal Project
I still am working on the session set up, I was able to complete most of it yesterday but now I have to figure out how to properly send the cookies as they are being read with their name as well
```
session_token=test_session_token
// Instead of
test_session_token
```

This was happening because I was reading the entire session token cookie and not just the seesionToken.Value
