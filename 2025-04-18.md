Again sick, But I will attempt to get one challenge done at least. Or complete pixelated.

### PicoCTF
##### [Pixelated cont.](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/100?difficulty=2&page=13&solved=1)
Continuation of my work on this challenge from [[2025-04-15#Pixelated]]
I have the solution but it's impossible for me to read so I am looking into how I can remove a specific colour from an image so that I can only see the flag instead of the grey surrounding it.

I can just shove it into paint and then fill the grey that I dont want with white to reveal the flag. 

### Personal Project:
Goal for the day: Get the sample data into MongoDB Atlas and then make a request with the API to get from the db to serve the CV sample.
