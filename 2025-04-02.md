Desc: Figure out how they moved the [flag](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/4fe0f4357f7458c6892af394426eab55/tftp.pcapng).
Given another pcapng I have to find the flag in it.

From here I will assume that whatever I find, it is plain text and is converted to octet to encode. Maybe not, it seems like octet is just how it is being transferred

I want to learn more about wireshark before I do this. It's another case of me not having the knowledge to be able to attack this problem yet.

Cryptography
Easy
A company stored a secret message on a server which got breached due to the admin using weakly hashed passwords. Can you gain access to the secret stored within the server?

The hash I see when connected to the machine is 
`482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38`
This looks to be an MD5 hash since MD5 always outputs 32 characters.

Im going to use the rockyou.txt with a bunch of sample passwords and try to hash each password to see if they match the hash I was given.

I wasn't able the read the rockyou.txt file into python and ended up needing to add errors='replace'
