Desc: Figure out how they moved the [flag](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/4fe0f4357f7458c6892af394426eab55/tftp.pcapng).
Given another pcapng I have to find the flag in it.

From here I will assume that whatever I find, it is plain text and is converted to octet to encode. Maybe not, it seems like octet is just how it is being transferred

I want to learn more about wireshark before I do this. It's another case of me not having the knowledge to be able to attack this problem yet.

Cryptography
Easy
A company stored a secret message on a server which got breached due to the admin using weakly hashed passwords. Can you gain access to the secret stored within the server?

The hash I see when connected to the machine is 
`482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38`
This looks to be an MD5 hash since MD5 always outputs 32 characters.

Im going to use the rockyou.txt with a bunch of sample passwords and try to hash each password to see if they match the hash I was given.

I wasn't able the read the rockyou.txt file into python and ended up needing to add errors='replace'
So after going through all of rockyou I did not match any of the password with the hash I was given This is because I did a bad job. No need to reinvent the wheel, instead I just used `hashcat`

The following command revealed a password
```
hashcat -m 0 -a 0 md5.txt rockyou.txt --show
482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38:password123
```

Once input that password gives another longer hash that is looks like an SHA1 hash so I will hashcat again the same way but for sha1

the output included this
```
hashcat -m 100 -a 0 sha1.txt rockyou.txt
Dictionary cache hit:
* Filename..: rockyou.txt
* Passwords.: 14344384
* Bytes.....: 139921497
* Keyspace..: 14344384

b7a875fc1ea228b9061041b7cec4bd3c52ab3ce3:letmein
```

showing me another password.
And another hash: `916e8c4f79b25028c9e467f1eb8eee6d6bbdff965f9928310ad30a8d88697745`
This one is 64 characters long which means its a SHA256 so we go back to hashcat.

Finally it outputs 
```
hashcat -m 1400 -a 0 sha256.txt rockyou.txt
Dictionary cache hit:
* Filename..: rockyou.txt
* Passwords.: 14344384
* Bytes.....: 139921497
* Keyspace..: 14344384

916e8c4f79b25028c9e467f1eb8eee6d6bbdff965f9928310ad30a8d88697745:qwerty098
```

In the end this was a simple dictionary attack to try every known password in rockyou against our hash. hashcat is a really interesting tool that does a lot of the legwork I was trying to do with my own hash checker. I should try to implement that checker on my own at a later date.

Desc: The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at?

It only checks the password for username Joe, anyone else it lets you log in freely no password. 

Maybe there is a way to smuggle Joe into the login? Or I can check for what is being sent in the request and just replace it with Joe later on.

I opened a walkthrough and the first thing it said was to pay attention to how it was checking and storing who was logged in, so I opened burpsuite and saw that the username and password was stored in the cookies as well as an Admin boolean. Using the inspector, I looked at the storage and changed the Admin bool to True and the username to Joe and it revealed the flag on refresh.

Desc: Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? `cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}`

I will just bring this to Cyberchef and put it through a ROT13 translator.
Simple as that.

Given the ugliest website I have ever seen and a prompt for a password, can we get in? 
With so little information I decided that I would check what the request looks like in burpsuite and saw the following in the html response. It shows what the order should be so I just have to reorder it the right way.

I also could have just looked at the html by using inspect page source and it would be shown
