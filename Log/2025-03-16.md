#### boot.dev
Started the docker course.
	- Download docker desktop
	- Test out the default starter container
	- Learned about running multiple container instances on different ports
	- Learned about [volumes](https://docs.docker.com/engine/storage/volumes/) and how they are setup

### PicoCTF
Unfortunately using mobaxterm instead of terminal since it's easier to transfer the files to my linux machine.

Back on this one. 
I can use bvi to see ![[Pasted image 20250316131338.png]]
but I have no idea what to do from here.
Turns out you just needed to modify the python file to run each of the passwords to figure out the right one. I think I need to realize that the simple solution can be the right one. Dont understand why they said that I could use bvi though.

##### [PW Crack 4](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/18?m=163)
Same exact problem as above. It makes me feel like using bvi was important but I dont have a clue of how I would get it to work.

##### [PW Crack 5](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/18?m=164)
Similar problem but the passwords were stored in a separate file. I simply added code that read the dictionary.txt file and split it on new lines and tried every password in it.

Download an image and find the flag.
The file was an svg, I believe that svgs are actually code, so it will scale properly as its size is modified. I assume the flag is in the drawing code.
It was in the code but it was broken apart so it was not easy to find. In the end I searched for "{" and that showed me where it was.  ![[Pasted image 20250316135000.png]]
##### [Big Zip](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/18?m=166)
zip with a bunch of files, taking a while to extract
have to cat all files, but there are folders. I found that I can use
```find . -type f -exec cat {} \;```
to see all the files. The following explains the whole command
>which means run the `find` command, to search the current directory (.) for all ordinary files (-type f). For each file found, run the application (-exec) cat, with the current file name as a parameter (the {} is a placeholder for the filename). The escaped semicolon is required to terminate the -exec clause.

Then I just grepped for 'pico'

Provided a java file, I have to look for the passwords in the source code.
It was just there in plain text. 

#### [keygenme-py](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/18?m=168)
Provided a python file, do something. No hints.
I can see that the license is made out of the hash or the username, so I have printed it at the start of the license check.
The character order is 45362718 which would be e584b363
it wasnt.
No Im stupid it was the answer, I needed to realize that the flag was just there, and it was the only piece missing.
#### [buffer overflow 0](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/18?m=169)
I just spammed characters and got the flag...
turns out that the input is only allowed to be 16 characters and anything over that overruns the buffer.
