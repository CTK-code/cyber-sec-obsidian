boot.dev
- Using a volume to persist data for an image.
	- Using the [ghost](https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost) image from docker hub.
-  Volumes are essentially directories from the host machine that are associated with a directory in the container. This allows for persistant data between removal and restart.
- Load Balancers
	- Receives traffic from clients and then forwards that traffic to different back end servers. Ideally these load balancers will prioritize sending traffic to backend servers that are under less load as to ease the burden of the more used servers.
- Application Servers:
	- We are using [caddy](https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy) (docker image) as our application server
- Custom Network:
	- We can create a network within docker that allows us to connect our application servers


PicoCTF:
Skipping Mochi's Tale for now, Im more interested in the actual code analysis	
Today I'm starting the binary analysis playlist. Apparently its a video game? [Mochi's Tale](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=6)
	
##### [ASCII Numbers](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=12):
The prompt was a bunch of hex values that held the pico flag. Using a hex to ascii converter I was able to convert the hexcode and access the flag.

##### [Picker I](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=14):
I am give a python scriipt that prompts the user to enter a command to get a random number. Having also been given the source code I can analyze it to see if there are any other commands that aren't immediately obvious.
I can see it uses to eval() method to call a method based on the user input. I also see that win() is a method that exists. I believe that inputting win will get me the flag.
Using win() returned ```
0x70 0x69 0x63 0x6f 0x43 0x54 0x46 0x7b 0x34 0x5f 0x64 0x31 0x34 0x6d 0x30 0x6e 0x64 0x5f 0x31 0x6e 0x5f 0x37 0x68 0x33 0x5f 0x72 0x30 0x75 0x67 0x68 0x5f 0x63 0x65 0x34 0x62 0x35 0x64 0x35 0x62 0x7d```
Which should be a pico flag.
Stripped the "0x" in the python cli, and used an online hex to ascii converter again to get this flag
