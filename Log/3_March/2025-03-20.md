[GDB baby step 1](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=25)
gdb is a debugger that can debug assembly
By using the debugger I was able to see the assembly code to analyze what was stored in eax.
This was an example of static analysis, we look over every line of code in order to discern what is happening in a program. The opposite of this is dynamic analysis, this is where we quickly run the program to see whats going on instead.
