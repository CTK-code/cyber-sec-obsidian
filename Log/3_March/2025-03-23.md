Post Wedding Day!

I havent done anything as Ive been sleeping all day.

Boot.dev:

[map\[string\]interface{}](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/f412afc4-5bde-4740-8d7e-fe814f00cfcc)
The goal of this was learning how to iterate over maps in go.

This is an old challenge that I skipped over initially, but I chose to do this challenge to continue my streak.


PicoCTF:

[Picker II](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=38)
The problem involves static code analysis to find out how to view the flag.

First I read the file in nvim, it lets me see that there is a filter that filters out the word win.

There is a call to eval(user_input + '()') so anything that I type out will try to be called. For fun I want to input print and see if it does anything (obviously just prints nothing but doesnt crash.)

Next, look for different methods that are defined.
I can see the following
```py
def getRandomNumber():
def exit():
def esoteric1():
def win():
def esoteric2():
def filter(user_input):
```

esoteric1/2 both print out C codeI think? It looks like it directly modifying the memory.

the win() method opens the flag but the filter removes any input that includes the word win. Somehow there must be a way to call the win method.

getRandomNumber always returns 4.

The hint says to try to do what the win command does without using the win command.

Perhaps I can do the entire command as a one liner.
Okay I didnt have to do multiple commands, I just had to call the read and strip methods to abuse the eval command. 
This is the solution I came up with.
```python
âžœ  throwaways nc saturn.picoctf.net 61446
==> open('flag.txt', 'r').read().strip
==> print(open('flag.txt', 'r').read().strip())
picoCTF{f1l73r5_f41l_c0d3_r3f4c70r_m1gh7_5ucc33d_b924e8e5}
```

Importantly, because we are doing a command by executing a string, we can force a comment by adding # and it removes the trailing ();
This makes me thing of SQL Injection, where if the sql inputs from the user were not sanitized we would be able to add our own custom SQL code and comment out their code so that we can see the whole table or such.
