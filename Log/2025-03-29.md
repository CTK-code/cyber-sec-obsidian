##### [Operation Orchid](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/285)
Desc: Download this disk image and find the flag.
Hypothesis: Using sleuthkit and probably a bunch of googling, I have to find the flag somewhere in the file system
Jumping off point: I want to see if I can find anything in the file system with a fls | grep or a srch_string after unzipping

Output of mmls
```bash
mmls disk.flag.img

The result of grepping for flag in fls is that I was able to see an encoded flag.
```bash
chris@dev-box:~/workspace/learning/cybersecurity/picoCTF/forensics/operation_orchid$ fls -r -o 411648 disk.flag.img | grep flag
+ r/r * 1876(realloc):	flag.txt
+ r/r 1782:	flag.txt.enc
chris@dev-box:~/workspace/learning/cybersecurity/picoCTF/forensics/operation_orchid$ icat -o 411648 disk.flag.img 1782

```

I saw in a John Hammond video that I can look at the history of an image to look for hints so I did and saw the following
```bash
chris@dev-box:~/workspace/learning/cybersecurity/picoCTF/forensics/operation_orchid$ fls -r -o 411648 disk.flag.img | grep history
+ r/r 1875:	.ash_history
chris@dev-box:~/workspace/learning/cybersecurity/picoCTF/forensics/operation_orchid$ icat -o 411648 disk.flag.img 1875
touch flag.txt
nano flag.txt
apk get nano
apk --help
apk add nano
nano flag.txt
openssl
openssl aes256 -salt -in flag.txt -out flag.txt.enc -k unbreakablepassword1234567
shred -u flag.txt
ls -al
halt
```

I can see that the flag was encrypted with openssl aes256 so I will look for a way to decode it 
I found a [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16056135/how-to-use-openssl-to-encrypt-decrypt-files) question about this and will have to figure out how to decrypt the file from the icat. I assume I can cat it then pipe it into a file then decrypt from there?

I think I am stuck on figuring out what the command to decrypt this would be. I am going to look at a write up to learn about openssl decryption.

Oh my god I was doing it right the whole time. I just never `cat`ed the output file because I assumed there was a problem when it gave me that bad decryption exception. I had the answer right the whole time.

```bash
openssl aes-256-cbc -d -pbkdf2 -salt -in flag.txt.enc -out flag.txt -k unbreakablepassword1234567
bad decrypt
40E73408B27F0000:error:1C800064:Provider routines:ossl_cipher_unpadblock:bad decrypt:../providers/implementations/ciphers/ciphercommon_block.c:124:
```
This command decrypted the file and saved it for me to cat it.

#### [Packet Primer](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/286)

Desc: Download the packet capture file and use packet analysis software to find the flag.
Hypothesis: I assume I just have to search through the packets that have been sent to see the flag in plain text (I hope)

I am realizing that I should probably do this on my Mac since I need to use the Wireshark GUI
I went through each of the 4 TCP packets and double clicked it to see the hex dump with the ascii.

This is the packet that we are interested in.
![[packets_primer_wireshark.png]]

This was pretty simple and the flag was easy to find.


#### Personal Project!

Okay so I had an idea for an application that tracks your jobs applications.

This will be done using a mongodb database, a go server and a react front end.
Or I could use sqlc, but I feel like a document database would be the easiest, then if I need to migrate to a raltional db I can take on that stupidly annoying process.
