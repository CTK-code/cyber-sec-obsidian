Hypothesis: There is a buffer overflow and I will have to figure out how to abuse it to get to another flag.

There is a "safe" variable that I can fill by overflowing a variable I can write to and somehow this will reveal the flag to me.

I start by overflowing with the alphabet:
`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz` // for reference and easy copying

By passing in the alphabet twice I was able to see that a `ghi` is where the overflow would begin. I replaced the characters past the second `g` with `pico` and that printed out the flag for me.

Hypothesis: Given a file binary, I will have to find the right pointer and possibly make a call to it.
