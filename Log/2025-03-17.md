boot.dev
- Using a volume to persist data for an image.
	- Using the [ghost](https://hub.docker.com/_/ghost) image from docker hub.
-  Volumes are essentially directories from the host machine that are associated with a directory in the container. This allows for persistant data between removal and restart.
- Load Balancers
	- Receives traffic from clients and then forwards that traffic to different back end servers. Ideally these load balancers will prioritize sending traffic to backend servers that are under less load as to ease the burden of the more used servers.
- Application Servers:
	- We are using [caddy](https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy) (docker image) as our application server
- Custom Network:
	- We can create a network within docker that allows us to connect our application servers
