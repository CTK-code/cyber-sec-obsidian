Cryptography
Desc: I have these 2 images, can you make a flag out of them?
Hypothesis: There is two halves of the flag hidden and I will have to find them using steganography tools like zsteg

As always, I check the file command after downloading the image to see what type of file it really is. They are both PNGs.
 
I didn't notice anything suspect when using `exiftool` on both files so from here I could either try looking through it with `hexdump || zsteg` and I will go with `zsteg` first

Using `zsteg scrambled1.png --extract 'b1,b,msb,xy'` I think I retrieved the public key but do not know how to decode it. I thought it would just be with the `gpg` command but I might not know how to use that properly.

Looking at the hint I see a link to [visual cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_cryptography) and so it seems like it will have to do with stacking the images instead of steganography.

I tried placing both images in gimp, laying them over each other and playing with their opacity and nothing came of it.

[Martin Carlisle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Yx2nxGcqU) is using the python library [Pillow](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/) to solve this one.
