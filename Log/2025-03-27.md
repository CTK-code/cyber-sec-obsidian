#### PicoCTF
I have started reading the [primer](https://primer.picoctf.org/). The discussion about the shell has provided no new information but it did provide a good [cheat sheet](https://www.git-tower.com/blog/command-line-cheat-sheet/) that I can use in the future.

The following challenge was recommended to do after I completed reading the first section of the primer.

[Magikarp Ground Mission](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/189)

Simple challenge meant to test my ability to use the shell. With a lot of prior shell experience with Mac and Ubuntu I expect this to be really easy.
All I had to do was successfully ssh into a remote server and then follow the instructions and move to the described directories to get the 3 parts of the flag.

[First Grep](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/85) was recommended but I had already completed it.
