Desc: The [numbers](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/f209a32253affb6f547a585649ba4fda/the_numbers.png)... what do they mean?

The numbers are just the character position in alphabet.

Figured out using an alphabet with the number values because I can't count.

Reverse Engineering
Desc: I wonder what this really is... [enc](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/1d8a5a2779c4dc24999f0358d7a1a786/enc) `''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])`
Using the code provided I have to figure out how to return the flag to it's original character?

The encoded flag is a bunch of chinese characters. 
`灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸彥㜰㍢㐸㙽`
I ran the encoding on the alphabet and it output this
`['慢', '捤', '敦', '杨', '楪', '歬', '浮', '潰', '煲', '獴', '當', '睸', '祺']`
It only outputs half the characters input. We see that in the way the for loop is designed.
`for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)]`
This only looks at every second value.
AH I see it! So in groups of two the first character is bit shifted 8 positions so that you can add the two numbers together and the bytes would line up
This allows us to add two binary numbers together and basically save each of them
ex: a = **01000001** b = **01000010** and this gave us 慢
so I surmise that 0100000101000010 should be that Chinese character
It's not. I understand what's happening just not sure where to go from here aside from writing a script to do it backwards.

This was my script to solve it. For each character I split them into the first and last 8 bits. I do this by shifting the ord(character) 8 bits to the right to only get the first half. This represents the first character.
Then I mask the second half so that the first half is just 0's
Note: I open the file because I can't copy paste the chinese characters into my editor for some reason.
```python
def decode(enc_flag):
    output = ""
    for c in enc_flag:
        i = ord(c)
        first = chr(i >> 8)
        second = chr(i & 0b11111111)
        output += first + second
        print(first)
        print(second)
    print(output)


def main():
    with open("./enc") as f:
        flag = f.read()
        _ = encode("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
        decode(flag)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```

Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition [http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/)

I had to look at a solution for a hint but I have learned about the HEAD http method.
HEAD is like a GET but only requests the header content.
By using burpsuite and modifying the POST to a HEAD it returned the flag

[Nice netcat...](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/156?difficulty=1&page=5)
Easy
General Skill
Desc: There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: `$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239`, but it doesn't speak English...

I assume that this means it will be encoded in hex or b64 or something along those lines

It's just decimal to ascii and I used a converter to find that flag

Web Exploitation
Desc: There is some interesting information hidden around this site [http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/). Can you find it?
It is broken across multiple parts of the website. The js, html and css
 picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_f7ce8828}
 In the js it had the comment `/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */` So I knew to look in the robots.txt
 Then in the robots.txt there is the comment
 `# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?`
 So I will look into how to look into the apache server. I found that I can look into the .htaccess file on the website an it
