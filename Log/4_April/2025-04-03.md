[The Numbers](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/68?difficulty=1&page=6)
Easy
Cryptography
Desc: The [numbers](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/f209a32253affb6f547a585649ba4fda/the_numbers.png)... what do they mean?
![[the_numbers.png]]
The numbers are just the character position in alphabet.

Figured out using an alphabet with the number values because I can't count.

[Transformation](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/104?difficulty=1&page=6)
Easy
Reverse Engineering
Desc: I wonder what this really is... [enc](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/1d8a5a2779c4dc24999f0358d7a1a786/enc) `''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])`
Using the code provided I have to figure out how to return the flag to it's original character?

The encoded flag is a bunch of chinese characters. 
`灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸彥㜰㍢㐸㙽`
I ran the encoding on the alphabet and it output this
`['慢', '捤', '敦', '杨', '楪', '歬', '浮', '潰', '煲', '獴', '當', '睸', '祺']`
It only outputs half the characters input. We see that in the way the for loop is designed.
`for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)]`
This only looks at every second value.
AH I see it! So in groups of two the first character is bit shifted 8 positions so that you can add the two numbers together and the bytes would line up
This allows us to add two binary numbers together and basically save each of them
ex: a = **01000001** b = **01000010** and this gave us 慢
so I surmise that 0100000101000010 should be that Chinese character
It's not. I understand what's happening just not sure where to go from here aside from writing a script to do it backwards.

This was my script to solve it. For each character I split them into the first and last 8 bits. I do this by shifting the ord(character) 8 bits to the right to only get the first half. This represents the first character.
Then I mask the second half so that the first half is just 0's
Note: I open the file because I can't copy paste the chinese characters into my editor for some reason.
```python
def decode(enc_flag):
    output = ""
    for c in enc_flag:
        i = ord(c)
        first = chr(i >> 8)
        second = chr(i & 0b11111111)
        output += first + second
        print(first)
        print(second)
    print(output)


def main():
    with open("./enc") as f:
        flag = f.read()
        _ = encode("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
        decode(flag)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Web Explotation
Find the flag being held on this server to get ahead of the competition [http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:34561/)

I had to look at a solution for a hint but I have learned about the HEAD http method.
HEAD is like a GET but only requests the header content.
By using burpsuite and modifying the POST to a HEAD it returned the flag

[Nice netcat...](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/156?difficulty=1&page=5)
Easy
General Skill
Desc: There is a nice program that you can talk to by using this command in a shell: `$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 43239`, but it doesn't speak English...

I assume that this means it will be encoded in hex or b64 or something along those lines

It's just decimal to ascii and I used a converter to find that flag

[Scavenger Hunt](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/161?difficulty=1&page=5)
Easy
Web Exploitation
Desc: There is some interesting information hidden around this site [http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/). Can you find it?
It is broken across multiple parts of the website. The js, html and css
 picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_f7ce8828}
 In the js it had the comment `/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */` So I knew to look in the robots.txt
 Then in the robots.txt there is the comment
 `# I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?`
 So I will look into how to look into the apache server. I found that I can look into the .htaccess file on the website an it told me to look into the DS_Store file. 
 Both of these files are files I had no idea existed so I had to look at a guide to see what the next step was.

##### [Static ain't always noise](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/163?difficulty=1&page=5)
Easy
General Skill
Desc: Can you look at the data in this binary: [static](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/e9dd71b5d11023873b8abe99cdb45551/static)? This [BASH script](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/e9dd71b5d11023873b8abe99cdb45551/ltdis.sh) might help!

With the provided BASH script I decoded the static. I had to `chmod -x` to make the script an executable and then it ran it with the static file as a cli argument. This created two files, a strings text file and an x86_64 text file.
The strings text file contained the whole flag so that is that.


##### [Cookies](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/173?difficulty=1&page=5)
Easy
Web Explotation
Desc: Who doesn't love cookies? Try to figure out the best one. [http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/](http://mercury.picoctf.net:27177/)
Hypothesis: I have to look at or manipulate cookies to  get the flag. 
As I input cookie types to the form, I can look at the web cookies and see that the value cookie is changing. I will manipulate it to see what different cookies there are and I figure eventually the flag will reveal itself.
Via bruteforcing with Burp Suite I was able to find the flag at cookie 18
Note: ctrl + space sends the repeater request

Our flag printing service has started glitching!

Additional details will be available after launching your challenge instance.
Once connected we see this printed

##### [Hashing Job App](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/243?difficulty=1&page=4)

It would give me a word and I just needed to get the md5 hash
I was using the following command to do it
`echo -n 'commuting' | md5sum`

##### [Includes](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/274?difficulty=1&page=4)
Easy
Web Exploitation
Desc: Can you get the flag?
Prompted with a button and clicking it pops up an alert saying that the code is in another file. With that I look at the page source and go to the script.js which has half the flag. Back on the page source I see that there is a css file that I can go into and that contains the remainder of the flag.

##### [Inspect HTML](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/275?difficulty=1&page=4)

Desc: Can you get the flag?
Open the website, open the page source and the flag is in a comment at the bottom

##### [Local Authority]
Easy
Web Exploitation
Desc: Can you get the flag?

There is a webpage with a login form. Ill open it in burpsuite and see what data is being transferred.

The following code is seen in the response so I will input those credentials and get the flag.
```javascript
function checkPassword(username, password)
{
  if( username === 'admin' && password === 'strongPassword098765' )
  {
    return true;
  }
  else
  {
    return false;
  }
}

##### [repetitions](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/371?difficulty=1&page=3)

General Skill
Desc: Can you make sense of this file?
Given an encoded flag I have to decode it
```
enc_flag
VmpGU1EyRXlUWGxTYmxKVVYwZFNWbGxyV21GV1JteDBUbFpPYWxKdFVsaFpWVlUxWVZaS1ZWWnVh
RmRXZWtab1dWWmtSMk5yTlZWWApiVVpUVm10d1VWZFdVa2RpYlZaWFZtNVdVZ3BpU0VKeldWUkNk

aGkKYlRrelZERldUMkpzUWxWTlJYTkxDZz09Cg==
```
I see the == at the end which makes me jump to Base64. Using CyberChef, I will try to decode it to get the flag.
I had to decode it multiple times.
I got a little stuck after the second decode since it no longer had the == at the end making me think it was a different encoding but I ended up checking the hint and it said that multiple decodes can be required so I did it I think five times to get the flag.

##### [Blame Game](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/405?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
General Skill
Desc: Someone's commits seems to be preventing the program from working. Who is it?
Given a git repo (single file really) I have to figure out who was at fault for breaking the code.
This is done by using the `git blame` command to see who made what changes. this revealed that the username of whoever broke the code was the flag.
