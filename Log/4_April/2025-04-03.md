The numbers are just the character position in alphabet.

Figured out using an alphabet with the number values because I can't count.

Desc: I wonder what this really is... [enc](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/1d8a5a2779c4dc24999f0358d7a1a786/enc) `''.join([chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1])) for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])`
Using the code provided I have to figure out how to return the flag to it's original character?

The encoded flag is a bunch of chinese characters. 
`灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸彥㜰㍢㐸㙽`
I ran the encoding on the alphabet and it output this
`['慢', '捤', '敦', '杨', '楪', '歬', '浮', '潰', '煲', '獴', '當', '睸', '祺']`
It only outputs half the characters input. We see that in the way the for loop is designed.
`for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)]`
This only looks at every second value.
AH I see it! So in groups of two the first character is bit shifted 8 positions so that you can add the two numbers together and the bytes would line up
This allows us to add two binary numbers together and basically save each of them
ex: a = **01000001** b = **01000010** and this gave us 慢
so I surmise that 0100000101000010 should be that Chinese character
