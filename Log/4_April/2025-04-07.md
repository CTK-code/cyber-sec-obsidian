##### [Rust fixme 3](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/463?difficulty=1&page=1)
Easy
General Skils:
Desc: Have you heard of Rust? Fix the syntax errors in this Rust file to print the flag!
Hypothesis: Another syntax error.

The comments showed that there was an unsafe call but also had the unsafe wrap.

##### [PIE TIME](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/490?difficulty=1&page=1)
Easy
Binary Exploitation
Desc: Can you try to get the flag? Beware we have PIE!
Hypothesis: Looking through a binary file but it has something to do with pi
![[pie_time.png]]
I have the binary and the c file and I see that the win function prints out the flag.
using `gdb` will help me look into the binary

I see that win and main are close, at these addresses
```asm
0x00000000000012a7  win
0x000000000000133d  main
```
Because I am given the address of main , I will subtract the difference between the win and main function in gdb from the address of main in the prompt.

That was it, I just need the difference between the two.
What did this have to do with PIE? 

##### [Fantasy CTF]()
Easy
General Skills
Desc: 
Hypothesis: This is meant for general learning about the cli most likely.
Spammed enter, answered the questions and got the flag.

##### [head-dump](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/476?difficulty=1&page=1)
Easy
Web Exploitation
Desc: Welcome to the challenge! In this challenge, you will explore a web application and find an endpoint that exposes a file containing a hidden flag. The application is a simple blog website where you can read articles about various topics, including an article about API Documentation. Your goal is to explore the application and find the endpoint that generates files holding the serverâ€™s memory, where a secret flag is hidden.
Hypothesis: I have to read through the api documentation to find the location of the flag so I can navigate to it.

![[head-dump-1.png]]
This is one of the articles, and so I will go to the api documentation.

I see this which is the name of the challenge so I hope this is it
![[Pasted image 20250407150445.png]]
This downloaded a .heapsnapshot file and apparently I can change the file extension to .json to make it easier to read

Opening the file in nvim I just /searched for pico and the flag was there. could have also used cat | grep 

##### [Cookie Monster Secret Recipe]()
Easy
Web Exploitation
Desc: Cookie Monster has hidden his top-secret cookie recipe somewhere on his website. As an aspiring cookie detective, your mission is to uncover this delectable secret. Can you outsmart Cookie Monster and find the hidden recipe?
Hypothesis: Ill have to look in the cookies for the flag.
Looking into the cookies I see this `secret_recipe=secret_recipe:"cGljb0NURntjMDBrMWVfbTBuc3Rlcl9sMHZlc19jMDBraWVzX0U2MzRERkJCfQ%3D%3D"`
So I assume this is probably base64 encoded.
The %3D%3D made me think that it ended in == so once I threw it into cyberchef I saw that the flag is `picoCTF{c00k1e_m0nster_l0ves_c00kies_E634DFBB}`

##### [EVEN RSA CAN BE BROKEN???](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/470?difficulty=1&page=1)
Easy
Cryptography
Desc: This service provides you an encrypted flag. Can you decrypt it with just N & e?
Hypothesis: There is a flag that is somehow encoded with just N and e there is a way to figure out what it means somehow....
