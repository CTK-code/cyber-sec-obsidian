Boot.Dev:

Learned about automatically pushing Docker images to the Google Artifact Repository.

This included creating the permissions for the Service account and then adding a secret key to my GitHub account.

Personal Projects:

I am trying to figure out how to get my 3D Printer properly setup.
It has been a couple of months since I have tried anything and I was having an issue with bed adhesion, leading to the prints always lifting. I had done it well with an ABS filament but right now I want to use PLA since apparently its less harmful (not not harmful.) 

A solution that was recommended was to use a glue stick on the glass build plate and see if that would help and so far it has combined with releveling the build plate again. I would love to get a  3D printer that auto levels but I don't do any 3D printing so its super unjustified.

Currently my goal is to find a way to mount my many different controllers so I am printing a [wall mount](https://www.multiboard.io/starter-packs/multiboard-tile) from Multiboard and seeing how that will fit in.

PicoCTF: 

Client Side Again cont...

Just have to figure out how to reverse engineer the check to see if I can get the flag from it. It has all the parts, I will figure out how to find and replace text using nvim and rename all the messy variables into stuff that's easier to follow.

Never mind it was just in the array at the start in plain text out of order. Reading comprehension strikes again!...
