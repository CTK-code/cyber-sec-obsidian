Desc: This [.tar file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/52084b5ad360b25f9af83933114324e0/1000.tar) got tarred a lot.
Hypothesis: I have to write a script that will keep untarring the file until it no longer is a tarball.

The following is the script that I have written for untaring a file and it would do all the tarballs in a folder but it doesn't for this since there is only one tarball. 
The next step is repeating the function as long as there is a file with the extension  .tar.  in Pseudocode it would basically be 
```pseudo
while file with .tar ext:
	untar && remove tarball
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in *.tar; do
  tar xvf "${file}" &&
    rm "${file}"
done
```

Below is the script that I ended up with that worked BUT it doesnt stop... I might have just put while true. I assumed that \*.tar would return a non-zero status code if it did not find a tarball and then exit the loop.
It's a png though so I have to get it off my linux machine into my mac

```bash
while [[ *.tar ]]; do
  for file in *.tar; do
    tar xvf "${file}" &&
      rm "${file}"
  done
done
```

I used [[Commands#scp]] and to copy the file to my laptop 
`picoCTF{l0t5_Of_TAR5}`

Desc: Sometimes you need to handle process data outside of a file. Can you find a way to keep the output from this program and search for the flag? Connect to `jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 14291`.

Hypothesis: I have to pipe the output of the `nc` to a file to save and process later.

When connecting to the challenge it prints out a long text that I will most likely have to grep for the flag.

`nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 14291 | grep pico` grabbed the flag for me right away.

Desc: There's a flag shop selling stuff, can you buy a flag?

Hypothesis: Code tracing to figure out the input that I will need to print the flag.

This code block tells me what the "win" condition is for this flag. 
Having an account balance of 100001+ will get me the flag when I buy the 1337 flag.

```c
else if(auction_choice == 2){
                printf("1337 flags cost 100000 dollars, and we only have 1 in stock\n");
                printf("Enter 1 to buy one");
                int bid = 0;
                fflush(stdin);
                scanf("%d", &bid);
                
                if(bid == 1){
                    
                    if(account_balance > 100000){
                        FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
                        if(f == NULL){

                            printf("flag not found: please run this on the server\n");
                            exit(0);
                        }
                        char buf[64];
                        fgets(buf, 63, f);
                        printf("YOUR FLAG IS: %s\n", buf);
                        }

```

Looking at the program, I can't submit negative numbers to try to add funds, but maybe I can add a huge value and underflow the input

![[flag_store_overflow.png]]I looked up the max value an int can store and then passed it in and it overflows and give me the equivalent of -1 flags.
Any value < the max value of an int would be the negative difference between the two. 
By using `2147480000` I was able to get more than enough money to get the flag.
I purchased the flag and it worked well.

Forget it I can just use a [vignere cypher solver](https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/vigenere-cipher)
and outputs CRYPTOISFUN. Makes more sense that DRYPTO for sure.

Desc: To get truly 1337, you must understand different data encodings, such as hexadecimal or binary. Can you get the flag from this program to prove you are on the way to becoming 1337? Connect with `nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 29956`.

Hypothesis: I have to translate different values to different encodings to get the flag.
