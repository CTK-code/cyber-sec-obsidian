Again sick, But I will attempt to get one challenge done at least. Or complete pixelated.

### PicoCTF
##### [Pixelated cont.](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/100?difficulty=2&page=13&solved=1)
Continuation of my work on this challenge from [[2025-04-15#Pixelated]]
I have the solution but it's impossible for me to read so I am looking into how I can remove a specific colour from an image so that I can only see the flag instead of the grey surrounding it.

I can just shove it into paint and then fill the grey that I dont want with white to reveal the flag. 

I used GIMP to change the value of the background pixels and that displayed the flag out in the open.
##### [Vault Door 3](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/60?difficulty=2&page=13&solved=1)
Medium
Reverse Engineering
Desc: This vault uses for-loops and byte arrays. The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor3.java](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/943ea40e3f54fca6d2145fa7aadc5e09/VaultDoor3.java)
Hypothesis: By following the loops I will be able to determine how to get through the "vault door" and at the flag.

```java
    public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
        if (password.length() != 32) {
            return false;
        }
        char[] buffer = new char[32];
        int i;
        for (i=0; i<8; i++) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
        }
        for (; i<16; i++) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(23-i);
        }
        for (; i<32; i+=2) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(46-i);
        }
        for (i=31; i>=17; i-=2) {
            buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
        }
        String s = new String(buffer);
        return s.equals("jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18g947_u_4_m9r54f");
    }
```
This code takes a shuffled version of the password and parses it to be the correct order, its now a matter of tracing how exactly it is being randomized.

If I just put the password back through this exact same process, would it reverse it the right way? I can add print statements to the code, use the password as the input and then try the output to see if it works.
That gives me the following

```java
  public boolean checkPassword(String password) {
    if (password.length() != 32) {
      return false;
    }
    char[] buffer = new char[32];
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
      buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
      System.out.print(password.charAt(i));
    }
    for (; i < 16; i++) {
      buffer[i] = password.charAt(23 - i);
      System.out.print(password.charAt(23 - i));
    }
    for (; i < 32; i += 2) {
      buffer[i] = password.charAt(46 - i);
      System.out.print(password.charAt(46 - i));
    }
    for (i = 31; i >= 17; i -= 2) {
      buffer[i] = password.charAt(i);
      System.out.print(password.charAt(i));
    }
    String s = new String(buffer);
    return s.equals("jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18g947_u_4_m9r54f");
  }
```
This doesnt work because my password is now too short. So I have to figure out where there is a part of the password being ignored.

`String input = userInput.substring("picoCTF{".length(), userInput.length() - 1);`
This is removing the `picoCTF{}` part of the password so I will now try with wrapping `jU5t_a_sna_3lpm18g947_u_4_m9r54f` in picoCTF{}
Im 90% sure it's `picoCTF{jU5t_a_s1mpl3_an4gr4m_4_u_798f59}`
But I did that by deduction and not through actual reverse engineering. And the digits at the end might be in the wrong order.

### Personal Project:
Goal for the day: Get the sample data into MongoDB Atlas and then make a request with the API to get from the db to serve the CV sample.

Right now I want to see if I can figure out how to host the Foodi web app we created on Azure on my own to see if I can get it to work. I won't do it with continuous deployment because that sounds liiiiike a nightmare for right now.

I will be using Google Cloud Service to host the website now since I have a guide from boot.dev to set it up and I think that would make it easiest.
