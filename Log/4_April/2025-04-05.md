Desc: RED, RED, RED, RED
Hypothesis: Given a completely red PNG there will be a part of the hexcode that is a flag

It's browser shell solvable so that makes me think I don't need to look at the actual image.

Much simpler than that, I used zsteg (which apparently I should not have sudo installed on my mac due to security reasons) and in the text field was the base64 encoded flag.
