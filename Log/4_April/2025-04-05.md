Hypothesis: Given a completely red PNG there will be a part of the hexcode that is a flag

It's browser shell solvable so that makes me think I don't need to look at the actual image.

Much simpler than that, I used zsteg (which apparently I should not have sudo installed on my mac due to security reasons) and in the text field was the base64 encoded flag.

Desc: Have you heard of Rust? Fix the syntax errors in this Rust file to print the flag!
Hypothesis: A rust file that has syntax errors. Haha easy. 

Rust is able to figure out what the problems are when it compiles. So when I compiled it showed where the errors were and recommended solutions.

To make this easier I installed the Mason lsp for Rust `rust-analyzer`

There were three errors in the file.
1) Unterminated line (missing ;)
2) Error with string interpolation in println macro
3) trying to return with `res` instead of an empty return

After fixing these errors I just had to run the program with `cargo run` and the flag was printed.

Desc: The Rust saga continues? I ask you, can I borrow that, pleeeeeaaaasseeeee?

Hypothesis: There is a rust file that will contain an error in how a variable is borrowed and I will have to fix it.

First I run `cargo run` to get all the packages that I need and then the compilation will explain what the errors are. The suggested solutions are that there are immutable variables that are trying to be mutated.

I will change these to be mutable and see if it can be run

The function was taking in an immutable reference and instead I had to change it so that it was mutables `borrowed_string: &String` -> `borrowed_string: &mut String`

Then I had to change the function call to pass in a `mut String` instead of a `String`

Desc: Have you heard of Rust? Fix the syntax errors in this Rust file to print the flag!

Hypothesis: More syntax errors, so most likely easily fixed with the suggested changes by the rust analyzer.

Note: I have been extracting the files with `tar -xzvf <tarball-name>`
