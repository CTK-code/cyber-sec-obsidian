Desc: History has failed us, but no matter. [Server source](https://challenge-files.picoctf.net/c_activist_birds/7eac27979c12e4bd449f03e40a8492044221b7d2a96ac85f1150e30983c56eac/server.tar.gz) There are two flags in this challenge. Submit flag one here, and flag two in **Pachinko Revisited**.

Hypothesis: ???

NAND means `not and` and this would mean both inputs cannot be the same?

No clue, will move on and come back later.

Desc: ABC Bank's website has a loan calculator to help its clients calculate the amount they pay if they take a loan from the bank. Unfortunately, they are using an `eval` function to calculate the loan. Bypassing this will give you Remote Code Execution (RCE). Can you exploit the bank's calculator and read the flag?

Hypothesis: I have to abuse the `eval` function and pass another method that will print out the flag.

WIth no source code to download, I will try opening the webpage in burpsuite and see what the response is.

`code=1*2%0D%0A` this is the data sent in the request when I pass in 1 * 2

The hint says that I need to bypass regex so I will look into how to do that.

Another that I don't think I know enough to do.
