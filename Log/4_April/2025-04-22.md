Personal Projects:
I 3D Printed a holder for my arduino and breadboard. Unfortunately the pegs that hold the arduino are a little bit too short so I will have to try to find a way to extend them so they actually hold the arduino in. I figure heating up push pins and then sliding them in will let me use the pins as a way to hold it in better.
