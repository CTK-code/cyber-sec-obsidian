Desc: 'Suspicious' is written all over this disk image. Download [suspicious.dd.sda1](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/0d39390cff1ab51699596b6e650e7cba/suspicious.dd.sda1)
Hypothesis: There is going to be a file labelled suspicious somewhere in this disk image that I need to find.

I will have to use SleuthKit for this.

Steps:
	1) `file <image>`
		- Tells me that it is an image
	2) `mmls <image>`
		- No information, no partitions I think
	3) `fls <image>`
		- Reveals suspicious file
		- ![[pitter_patter_platter.png]]
		- V/V is a virtual folder not originally in the image, created by sleuthkit.
	4) `icat <image> 12`
		- ![[pitter_patter_platter_2.png]]
		- Not sure where the arrow is pointing, perhaps another folder?
		- Nothing to see here! But you may want to look here -->
	5) ` sudo mount -o loop ./suspicious.dd.sda1 /mnt/dir`
		- I mounted the image so that I can root around through the files myself. I did not know that I could do this and it also feels unsafe since the files are now in my system but I don't know enough about whether this is technically bad or not.
		- The hint mentioned looking at something called slack space
