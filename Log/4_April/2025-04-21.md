Desc: 'Suspicious' is written all over this disk image. Download [suspicious.dd.sda1](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/0d39390cff1ab51699596b6e650e7cba/suspicious.dd.sda1)
Hypothesis: There is going to be a file labelled suspicious somewhere in this disk image that I need to find.

I will have to use SleuthKit for this.

Steps:
	1) `file <image>`
		- Tells me that it is an image
	2) `mmls <image>`
		- No information, no partitions I think
	3) `fls <image>`
		- Reveals suspicious file
		- ![[pitter_patter_platter.png]]
		- V/V is a virtual folder not originally in the image, created by sleuthkit.
	4) `icat <image> 12`
		- ![[pitter_patter_platter_2.png]]
		- Not sure where the arrow is pointing, perhaps another folder?
		- Nothing to see here! But you may want to look here -->
	5) ` sudo mount -o loop ./suspicious.dd.sda1 /mnt/dir`
		- I mounted the image so that I can root around through the files myself. I did not know that I could do this and it also feels unsafe since the files are now in my system but I don't know enough about whether this is technically bad or not.
		- The hint mentioned looking at something called slack space 
	6) Looks like I may need to use Autopsy to find it.
	7) `blkls -s <image>`
		- Let me look at only the data in the slack space of the image. This revealed that the flag is in reverse in the slack space.

Summary: I learned about slack space and the `blkls` command to look at the slack space in images. I also learned how to mount a disk image to my file system. And how to unmount them.

Desc: Can you beat the filters? Log in as admin [http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9683/](http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9683/) [http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9683/filter.php](http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:9683/filter.php)
Hypothesis: I will have to use different type of input injections to add code to break the filter.

Steps:
	1) Input a random password for user 'admin'
		- `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='test'` appears at the top of the web page showing the exact SQL statement being used.
	2) Passing `admin';#` bypasses the filter and ignores the password getting me into the next page. Note: Comments are made with -- not # so this works because of the ; not the #
		- `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin';#' AND password='test'`
	3) The filter page is showing what is being filtered from the inputs. For this one it was `or and like = --` so the same input I used before worked to bypass the filter
		1) Filter: `Round3: or and = like > < --`
