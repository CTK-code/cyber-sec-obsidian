##### [Bookmartlet](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/406?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
Web Exploitation
Desc: Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?
Hypothesis: Given the code for the bookmarklet I have to find out how to execute it as a bookmarklet

I grabbed the code and shoved it into the web console and it output the flag.


##### [binhexa](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/404?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
General Skills
Desc: How well can you perfom basic binary operations?
Hypothesis: Given a binary file I have to make it output a flag.
It was practice to bit shifting and addition/multiplication of binary numbers. Quite easy and then it spits out the flag.

##### [CanYouSee](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/408?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
Forensics
Desc: How about some hide and seek?
Hypothesis: Given a file I have to look through itand find a flag. It might be hidden in an obvious but strange way.

It's a png file. I dont' feel like looking at it quite yet (and I dont want to download it onto my laptop) so Ill use tools like `exiftool` and `hexdump`

Using exiftool I can see that the flag is in the attributed URL (probably) because it is encoded in Base64. I know this because of the == at the end
![[can_you_see.png]]Using CyberChef I was able decode from Base64 and retrieve the flag.


##### [Commitment Issues](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/411?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
General Skills
Desc: I accidentally wrote the flag down. Good thing I deleted it!
Hypothesis: Because the title includes 'commit' I will look for a through the git history and look at the diffs to see the flag.

Using `git log` to look at the commit history, I see that there is a commit that removed the flag
Using `git show <commit-id>`  Showed the diff for that commit so I saw what the flag was. 


##### [Collaborative Development](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/410?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
General Skills
Desc: My team has been working very hard on new features for our flag printing program! I wonder how they'll work together?
Hypothesis: I will have to look through the git history and the program to see the flag. It could be that the commiters combined are the flag.

The log shows no history but there are three branches that contain the flag. The flag parts are in the flag.py file one each of the branch.

##### [endianness](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/414?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
General Skils
Desc: Know of little and big endian?
Hypothesis: I have to look at a file and look at the contents which will hold the flag in little and big endian.

There was a cli prompt that wanted me to input the little and big endian versions of a string.

Basically, the string in reverse hex in little edian since the last character would be the "least significant" and it is the regular word in hex for big endian. 

I struggled with this because in my mind "least significant" would mean that it is an unimportant character but it seems like it just means the last byte. If I think about it in terms of a number it makes sense though, the last byte would be the least significant because it makes the smallest change if it is removed.

I brute forced this one a little bit so I should spend some time learning about big and little endians just like Gulliver did on his travels.

##### [Secret of the Polyglot](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/423?difficulty=1&page=2)
Easy
Forensics
Desc: The Network Operations Center (NOC) of your local institution picked up a suspicious file, they're getting conflicting information on what type of file it is. They've brought you in as an external expert to examine the file. Can you extract all the information from this strange file?
Hypothesis: Based on the use of Polyglot, I think it will either be multiple different languages or mutliple different encodings that I will have to look into to get the flag.

`flag2of2-final.pdf` is the file that is downloaded for the challenge. I started by using the `file` command to findout that it is not actually a pdf but it is a png. 
`cat flag2of2-final.pdf` had a bunch of metadata that I am unsure if it is normal for pngs to have, so I will cat another png on my system to see and it does not include the metadata at the end.

Opening the pdf gave me `1n_pn9_&_pdf_53b741d6}` as half of the flag.

Maybe I have to change the extension to png to get the first half.
By changing the extension and opening it as a png it gave me this.

On closer inspection, I can see that this file contains both the header for a png and a PDF. After the PDF header is where the human readable content is and that is what tipped me off that it might be two different files completely.

##### [Ph4nt0m 1ntrud3r](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/459?difficulty=1&page=2)
Easy
Forensics
Desc: A digital ghost has breached my defenses, and my sensitive data has been stolen! ðŸ˜±ðŸ’» Your mission is to uncover how this phantom intruder infiltrated my system and retrieve the hidden flag. To solve this challenge, you'll need to analyze the provided PCAP file and track down the attack method. The attacker has cleverly concealed his moves in well timely manner. Dive into the network traffic, apply the right filters and show off your forensic prowess and unmask the digital intruder!

Hypothesis: There will be a flag split between multiple payloads probably hidden in hex.

There are a bunch of failed transmissions and each of them contain a Base64 encoded value at the end. Ill collect all of them and see what they are containing

There are a ton of different things that I have to look through and I'm trying to figure out what I need and what I don't.
