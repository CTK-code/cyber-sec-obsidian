Easy
Web Exploitation
Desc: Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?
Hypothesis: Given the code for the bookmarklet I have to find out how to execute it as a bookmarklet

I grabbed the code and shoved it into the web console and it output the flag.

General Skills
Desc: How well can you perfom basic binary operations?
Hypothesis: Given a binary file I have to make it output a flag.
It was practice to bit shifting and addition/multiplication of binary numbers. Quite easy and then it spits out the flag.

##### [CanYouSee](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/408?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
Forensics
Desc: How about some hide and seek?
Hypothesis: Given a file I have to look through itand find a flag. It might be hidden in an obvious but strange way.

It's a png file. I dont' feel like looking at it quite yet (and I dont want to download it onto my laptop) so Ill use tools like `exiftool` and `hexdump`

Using exiftool I can see that the flag is in the attributed URL (probably) because it is encoded in Base64. I know this because of the == at the end
![[can_you_see.png]]Using CyberChef I was able decode from Base64 and retrieve the flag.


##### [Commitment Issues](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/411?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
General Skills
Desc: I accidentally wrote the flag down. Good thing I deleted it!
Hypothesis: Because the title includes 'commit' I will look for a through the git history and look at the diffs to see the flag.

Using `git log` to look at the commit history, I see that there is a commit that removed the flag
Using `git show <commit-id>`
