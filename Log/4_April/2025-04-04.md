##### [Bookmartlet](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/406?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
Web Exploitation
Desc: Why search for the flag when I can make a bookmarklet to print it for me?
Hypothesis: Given the code for the bookmarklet I have to find out how to execute it as a bookmarklet

I grabbed the code and shoved it into the web console and it output the flag.


##### [binhexa](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/404?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
General Skills
Desc: How well can you perfom basic binary operations?
Hypothesis: Given a binary file I have to make it output a flag.
It was practice to bit shifting and addition/multiplication of binary numbers. Quite easy and then it spits out the flag.

##### [CanYouSee](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/408?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
Forensics
Desc: How about some hide and seek?
Hypothesis: Given a file I have to look through itand find a flag. It might be hidden in an obvious but strange way.

It's a png file. I dont' feel like looking at it quite yet (and I dont want to download it onto my laptop) so Ill use tools like `exiftool` and `hexdump`

Using exiftool I can see that the flag is in the attributed URL (probably) because it is encoded in Base64. I know this because of the == at the end
![[can_you_see.png]]Using CyberChef I was able decode from Base64 and retrieve the flag.


##### [Commitment Issues](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/411?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
General Skills
Desc: I accidentally wrote the flag down. Good thing I deleted it!
Hypothesis: Because the title includes 'commit' I will look for a through the git history and look at the diffs to see the flag.

Using `git log` to look at the commit history, I see that there is a commit that removed the flag
Using `git show <commit-id>`  Showed the diff for that commit so I saw what the flag was. 


##### [Collaborative Development](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/410?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
General Skills
Desc: My team has been working very hard on new features for our flag printing program! I wonder how they'll work together?
Hypothesis: I will have to look through the git history and the program to see the flag. It could be that the commiters combined are the flag.

The log shows no history but there are three branches that contain the flag. The flag parts are in the flag.py file one each of the branch.

##### [endianness](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/414?difficulty=1&page=3)
Easy
General Skils
Desc: Know of little and big endian?
Hypothesis: I have to look at a file and look at the contents which will hold the flag in little and big endian.
