### [Picker IV](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=43)

This one is about using static code analysis to read from both a binary and a c file. 

I can see the win method at the top of the file. 
It will prompt me for the hex code value of where I want to jump to in the assembly code.

I assume this means that I can find the win method in the binary so we go to GDB !

Here are the functions that I can see and so I assume I just put in the win function to get the answer. Lets give it a shot!

My god, after the struggle I had with the python one, having a simple solution was so nice.
The flag was just

Apparently this is going to be important.
```bash
`$ python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write('a'*36)"`
```
Typically fuzzing (trying a bunch of inputs) using a bunch of 'a' characters is common to try to abuse things.

It didn't produce anything for me but I get the concept. Its to get the desired amount of 'a'.

"Smash the stack"
I assume Im gonna be popping a bunch of things off the stack but I have no real clue.

I am given a C file and it's assembly code and Ill have to grab the flag from that. 

First off, Ill see what the container looks like
```bash
Enter a string: test

num is 64
Bye!
```
And then it crashses? It doesnt take any more inputs now.
okay... I guess Ill have to read a bit...

```C
  char input[16];
  int num = 64;
  
  printf("Enter a string: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  gets(input);
  printf("\n");
  
  printf("num is %d\n", num);
  fflush(stdout);
  
  if( num == 65 ){
    printf("You win!\n");
    fflush(stdout);
```
So this is how we win. So I think that that means that I need to overflow the char[16] input to the point where it modifies the num variable.

Using this command 
```bash
 python3 -c "print(24 * 'a')"
```
I can try a bunch of different amounts of a's and I can now see that at 24 'a's the output is 0.
Now when I add another a it outputs 97. This is the value of the character a, so I just need to figure out the values of each ascii character.

I have added an Resources folder and put the [[ASCII Table]] there for future reference.
I find that the value I need is 65 and that is 'A'
With the input of 24 a and one A I get the flag.

I am surprised that it took 24 charaters to over flow instead of 16. I had assumed that 16 bytes would be enough to overflow the char\[] but it seems that because it is in a char\[] there is an additional buffer of 8bytes. 
Actually, this buffer could be just that the num variable was initialized 8 bytes later in the memory than the input array.

This shows 64 being moved into the -0x8 address. So I should be able to find the char array 24 bytes away from there.
```
   0x0000000000401242 <+12>:	movl   $0x40,-0x8(%rbp)
```
So because the char input\[16] is the first variable defined, it is most likely that it is stored in the -0x20(%rax) address since this is the start of the stack frame.
THIS WAS TAKEN FROM CHATGPT SO GRAIN OF SALT BUD.



### [buffer overflow 1](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=49)
"Control the return address"
Hypothesis: I figure this means that I am somehow modifying what is being returned by pushing an input into the address.
