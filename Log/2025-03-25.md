### [Picker IV](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=43)

This one is about using static code analysis to read from both a binary and a c file. 

I can see the win method at the top of the file. 
It will prompt me for the hex code value of where I want to jump to in the assembly code.

I assume this means that I can find the win method in the binary so we go to GDB !

Here are the functions that I can see and so I assume I just put in the win function to get the answer. Lets give it a shot!

My god, after the struggle I had with the python one, having a simple solution was so nice.
The flag was just

Apparently this is going to be important.
```bash
`$ python3 -c "import sys; sys.stdout.buffer.write('a'*36)"`
```
Typically fuzzing (trying a bunch of inputs) using a bunch of 'a' characters is common to try to abuse things.

It didn't produce anything for me but I get the concept. Its to get the desired amount of 'a'.

"Smash the stack"
I assume Im gonna be popping a bunch of things off the stack but I have no real clue.

I am given a C file and it's assembly code and Ill have to grab the flag from that. 

First off, Ill see what the container looks like
```bash
Enter a string: test

num is 64
Bye!
```
And then it crashses? It doesnt take any more inputs now.
okay... I guess Ill have to read a bit...

```C
  char input[16];
  int num = 64;
  
  printf("Enter a string: ");
  fflush(stdout);
  gets(input);
  printf("\n");
  
  printf("num is %d\n", num);
  fflush(stdout);
  
  if( num == 65 ){
    printf("You win!\n");
    fflush(stdout);
```
So this is how we win. So I think that that means that I need to overflow the char[16] input to the point where it modifies the num variable.

Using this command 
```bash
 python3 -c "print(24 * 'a')"
```
I can try a bunch of different amounts of a's and I can now see that at 24 'a's the output is 0.
Now when I add another a it outputs 97. This is the value of the character a, so I just need to figure out the values of each ascii character.

I have added an Resources folder and put the [[ASCII Table]] there for future reference.
I find that the value I need is 65 and that is 'A'
With the input of 24 a and one A I get the flag.

I am surprised that it took 24 charaters to over flow instead of 16. I had assumed that 16 bytes would be enough to overflow the char\[] but it seems that because it is in a char\[] there is an additional buffer of 8bytes. 
Actually, this buffer could be just that the num variable was initialized 8 bytes later in the memory than the input array.

This shows 64 being moved into the -0x8 address. So I should be able to find the char array 24 bytes away from there.
```
   0x0000000000401242 <+12>:	movl   $0x40,-0x8(%rbp)
```
So because the char input\[16] is the first variable defined, it is most likely that it is stored in the -0x20(%rax) address since this is the start of the stack frame.
THIS WAS TAKEN FROM CHATGPT SO GRAIN OF SALT BUD.



### [buffer overflow 1](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=49)
"Control the return address"
Hypothesis: I figure this means that I am somehow modifying what is being returned by pushing an input into the address.

Once I connect to the container I see this:
```bash
Please enter your string:
asdfasdfasdf
Okay, time to return... Fingers Crossed... Jumping to 0x804932f
```
So the input that I am giving it is determining where in the memory we are jumping to. So easily I have to find out the value of the win function in the hexcode and then jump there.

I can see that the jump command changes when I input a bunch of As
```
Please enter your string:
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Okay, time to return... Fingers Crossed... Jumping to 0x41414141
```

I have determined that the return value remains the same until 44 characters are used as an input.
I see that the win address is ```0x080491f6``` and I need to get there from ```0x804932f```.

When I add an additional A I get the address ```0x8049300```
I could do the math to figure out what inputs I need to get the the right address but I will just brute force it.

134517238 - 134517551 = - 313 so I need to add 313 in ASCII characters

I ended up looking at the answer to see what they suggest doing. They suggest using the alphabet as the input as it can help us determine where we need to be looking. I will now try doing that.

```bash
chris@dev-box:~/workspace/learning/cybersecurity$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 52608
Please enter your string:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
Okay, time to return... Fingers Crossed... Jumping to 0x76757473
```
So because we can see that the hex is ```0x76757473``` This is assosciated with the letters stuv.  This is what was given by the solution. I think I was making my way towards this but it wasnt going to be as clean and definitely would have taken way longer for me.
