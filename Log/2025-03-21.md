Boot.dev:

Another day of not doing any of it. I just dont want to, I have no interest in learning GitHub actions through a course, I learn them better when I do it myself.

#### [GDB Baby Step 2](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=29)
With the preamble for the GDB break points, I assume that I need to add a breakpoint to the program with gdb and then print out the value of the eax during runtime. Details  at [break](GDB#`(gdb) break *main+59`)
I should check if this will also help with the first problem to print the eax register at the end
