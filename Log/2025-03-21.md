Whooping Cough!!!!

Boot.dev:

Another day of not doing any of it. I just dont want to, I have no interest in learning GitHub actions through a course, I learn them better when I do it myself.

PicoCTF:
#### [GDB Baby Step 2](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=29)
With the preamble for the GDB break points, I assume that I need to add a breakpoint to the program with gdb and then print out the value of the eax during runtime. Details  at [break](GDB#`(gdb) break *main+59`)
I should check if this will also help with the first problem to print the eax register at the end

Having trouble figuring out how to run the debugger, it seems like it should just be `run` when Im in gdb but it doesnt want to work for me.

It prompts me with `dont know how to run`. 
After some googling it appears that it is because I am on Mac, perhaps because Im on M1, so I have to set a flag for the architecture.

````bash
gdb -arch x86_64 <file-name>
````
That didnt do it.
Instead of doing the tough thing and figuring out why this wont work on my Mac, I will instead ssh into my linux machine and do my work there.
I might be stupid. the first thing I did when Iwent into my linux machine was chmod the file so that it could execute. I am assuming that since it did not have execute permissions before, gdb couldnt run it because it shouldnt be able to.  Nope. That wasnt it. I give in time to ssh.
