Whooping Cough!!!!

Boot.dev:

Another day of not doing any of it. I just dont want to, I have no interest in learning GitHub actions through a course, I learn them better when I do it myself.

PicoCTF:
#### [GDB Baby Step 2](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=29)
With the preamble for the GDB break points, I assume that I need to add a breakpoint to the program with gdb and then print out the value of the eax during runtime. Details  at [break](GDB#`(gdb) break *main+59`)
I should check if this will also help with the first problem to print the eax register at the end

Having trouble figuring out how to run the debugger, it seems like it should just be `run` when Im in gdb but it doesnt want to work for me.

It prompts me with `dont know how to run`. 
After some googling it appears that it is because I am on Mac, perhaps because Im on M1, so I have to set a flag for the architecture.

````bash
gdb -arch x86_64 <file-name>
````
That didnt do it.
Instead of doing the tough thing and figuring out why this wont work on my Mac, I will instead ssh into my linux machine and do my work there.
I might be stupid. the first thing I did when Iwent into my linux machine was chmod the file so that it could execute. I am assuming that since it did not have execute permissions before, gdb couldnt run it because it shouldnt be able to.  Nope. That wasnt it. I give in time to ssh. It seems like this is an issue with Mac and gdb so I wont press it for now, I have access to a linux machine and thats fine.

In the end I set a break point near the end of the program and then inspected the eax register.

OKAY SO I know that relying on AI is bad, but I asked ChatGPT to explain this code to me line by line and this is the result.

Let's break down the provided assembly code line by line:

```nasm
0x0000000000401106 <+0>:    endbr64
```

- **`endbr64`** is an instruction that is part of Intel's Control Flow Enforcement Technology (CET). It helps enforce control flow integrity (CFI), which protects against certain types of exploits like Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) attacks. It marks the end of a function or a valid branch.

```nasm
0x000000000040110a <+4>:    push   %rbp
```

- **`push %rbp`**: This instruction pushes the value of the `rbp` register (the base pointer) onto the stack. This is typically done to save the previous stack frame pointer when entering a function.

```nasm
0x000000000040110b <+5>:    mov    %rsp,%rbp
```

- **`mov %rsp,%rbp`**: This instruction moves the value of the `rsp` register (the stack pointer) into the `rbp` register, effectively setting up a new stack frame. `rbp` will now serve as the frame pointer for this function.

```nasm
0x000000000040110e <+8>:    mov    %edi,-0x14(%rbp)
```

- **`mov %edi, -0x14(%rbp)`**: The value in the `edi` register (typically the first integer argument to a function) is stored at the memory location `rbp - 0x14`. This is part of the function's prologue, where arguments are saved into local variables.

```nasm
0x0000000000401111 <+11>:   mov    %rsi,-0x20(%rbp)
```

- **`mov %rsi, -0x20(%rbp)`**: The value in the `rsi` register (typically the second integer argument to a function) is stored at `rbp - 0x20`, another location in the stack frame.

```nasm
0x0000000000401115 <+15>:   movl   $0x1e0da,-0x4(%rbp)
```

- **`movl $0x1e0da, -0x4(%rbp)`**: This instruction stores the immediate value `0x1e0da` (which is a constant value, likely an integer) at the memory location `rbp - 0x4`. This could be initializing a local variable.

```nasm
0x000000000040111c <+22>:   movl   $0x25f,-0xc(%rbp)
```

- **`movl $0x25f, -0xc(%rbp)`**: This stores the value `0x25f` (607 in decimal) into the memory location `rbp - 0xc`.

```nasm
0x0000000000401123 <+29>:   movl   $0x0,-0x8(%rbp)
```

- **`movl $0x0, -0x8(%rbp)`**: This sets a local variable at `rbp - 0x8` to `0`. This might be initializing a loop counter or similar.

```nasm
0x000000000040112a <+36>:   jmp    0x401136 <main+48>
```

- **`jmp 0x401136`**: This is an unconditional jump. The program jumps to the address `0x401136`, which is the location where the loop starts. This is a jump to avoid executing the next instruction (which is part of the loop) right away.

```nasm
0x000000000040112c <+38>:   mov    -0x8(%rbp),%eax
```

- **`mov -0x8(%rbp), %eax`**: This moves the value at the memory location `rbp - 0x8` (which was previously set to 0) into the `eax` register.

```nasm
0x000000000040112f <+41>:   add    %eax,-0x4(%rbp)
```

- **`add %eax, -0x4(%rbp)`**: This adds the value in `eax` (which is the value at `rbp - 0x8`) to the value at `rbp - 0x4`. Essentially, this increments the value at `rbp - 0x4` by the value in `eax`.

```nasm
0x0000000000401132 <+44>:   addl   $0x1,-0x8(%rbp)
```

- **`addl $0x1, -0x8(%rbp)`**: This adds `1` to the value at `rbp - 0x8`. This is likely incrementing a loop counter.

```nasm
0x0000000000401136 <+48>:   mov    -0x8(%rbp),%eax
```

- **`mov -0x8(%rbp), %eax`**: This moves the value at `rbp - 0x8` (the loop counter) into `eax`.

```nasm
0x0000000000401139 <+51>:   cmp    -0xc(%rbp),%eax
```

- **`cmp -0xc(%rbp), %eax`**: This compares the value in `eax` (the loop counter) to the value at `rbp - 0xc` (which is 607, from an earlier `mov` instruction). The comparison checks if the loop counter has reached 607.

```nasm
0x000000000040113c <+54>:   jl     0x40112c <main+38>
```

- **`jl 0x40112c`**: This is a conditional jump. If the value in `eax` is less than the value at `rbp - 0xc` (607), the program jumps back to `0x40112c`, effectively looping.

```nasm
0x000000000040113e <+56>:   mov    -0x4(%rbp),%eax
```

- **`mov -0x4(%rbp), %eax`**: This moves the final value from `rbp - 0x4` into `eax`. This is likely the result of the loop, which was modified in the earlier instructions.

```nasm
0x0000000000401141 <+59>:   pop    %rbp
```

- **`pop %rbp`**: This restores the base pointer (`rbp`) by popping the value from the stack, which was saved at the beginning of the function. This effectively ends the current stack frame.

```nasm
0x0000000000401142 <+60>:   ret
```

- **`ret`**: This is the return instruction. It returns from the function, popping the return address from the stack and transferring control back to the caller.

---

### Overall explanation:

This assembly code represents the body of the `main` function in a program. It sets up the stack frame, saves function arguments, and runs a loop where a counter (`rbp - 0x8`) is incremented until it reaches the value `607` (stored at `rbp - 0xc`). The value at `rbp - 0x4` is updated in the loop and returned at the end.

- The loop adds the value of the counter to a variable stored at `rbp - 0x4`.
- Once the loop completes, the function returns the final value stored in `rbp - 0x4`.

Okay now me trying to figure it out with only looking at the first little bit:

+8 we set up memory for %edi
+11 we do the same for %rsi

// The following sets up our variables (probably)
+15 we save the value of 0x1e0da into mem location -0x4 of the rbp stack (123098)
+22 we save the value of 0x25f into -0xc (607)
+29 save the value of 0x0 into 0x8 of rbp

+36 jump to +48 and execute from there.
+48 puts the value of -0x8(%rbp) into the %eax register (%eax now contains 0)
+51 compares the value at 0xc to whats stored in eax. 
+54 isince -0xc (123098) < the value in %eax (0), jump to +38

// Loops until 0x8 = 607
+38 move the value in %eax into 0x8 (still 0)
+41 add -0x4 to %eax (0 + 123098)
+44 add 1 to 0x8 (0) = 1
+48 move 0x8 into %eax
+51 compare 0xc (607) < %eax (1)
+54 if -0xc (123098) < the value in %eax (0), jump to +38 ..........
