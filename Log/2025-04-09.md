Desc: Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:64649
Hypothesis: A simple upgrade to the last irish-name-repo where I had to perform SQL injection. I assume that means that the inputs are properly sanitized now. 

I will start off by trying to log in right away and seeing what the request shape is.

Seeing that debug is there again I try it and see that there is still the SQL statement being shown.
Trying the same SQL injection as the last problem grants me the flag again. It makes me think I was supposed to do something different with the last problem but I do not know what that would be.
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' --' AND passowrd=''

Web Exploitation
Desc: There is a secure website running at `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/29132/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/29132/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:29132. Try to see if you can login as admin!
Hypothesis: We can probably still get through with SQL injection as it doesn't seem it was the intended solution for the last two problems. I will have to look up what those solutions are supposed to be, however I assume most people used SQL injection.

First I will open it in BurpSuite and look at the shape of the request. If debug still is there I will try the exact same SQL injection attack to see if it works.

The following is the response when I tried to pass an SQL injection as a password. Because it is being filtered in what looks like a caesar cypher shift, I will try passing the values that will lead to BE becoming OR

The did not work so I will try to look through other possible exploits.

The SQL query needs to have spaces to know what's going on, so I found that using + in query parameters acts as a space and that means that I can put in a full request. 
`OR 1=1` works because now the query looks for either a correct password OR a situation where 1=1 and (hopefully) 1 always equals 1. To me.

##### [asm-1]()

Reverse Engineering
Desc: What does asm1(0x8be) return? Submit the flag as a hexadecimal value (starting with '0x'). NOTE: Your submission for this question will NOT be in the normal flag format. [Source](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/66c927e32f3d7be7a62d13a7c2250943/test.S)
Hypothesis: Looking through the assembly for the return address 0x8be and seeing how asm1 manipulates it. It might also not be an address and just the hex value.
