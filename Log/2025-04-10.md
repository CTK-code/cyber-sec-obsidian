Hypothesis: There is a buffer overflow and I will have to figure out how to abuse it to get to another flag.



Personal Project:
Spent most of the day styling the CV component and ensuring that it worked kind of. I have the summary and skills sections left to do at this point and from there I can start working on the backend and how I want to store it. It will likely be stored as part of a document database, most likely using Atlas to host the database.

I had an issue with the following code and it was because I needed to return the component when mapping. The fix is below.
```javascript
const projectData = projects.map((project) => {
    <Project project={project}></Project>
  })

// VS.  

const projectData = projects.map((project) => {
    return <Project project={project}></Project>
  })
```
