###  [Picker III](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=40)
Similar to Picker II, I have to find the way to print the flag from this program.

Opening the file and reading I can see the following methods:
```python
def reset_table()
def check_table()
def get_func(n)
def print_table()
def filter_var_name(var_name)
def read_variable()
def filter_value(value)
def call_func(n)
def dummy_func1()
def dummy_func2()
def dummy_func3()
def dummy_func4()
def getRandomNumner()
def win()
def help_text()
```

I see that within call_func(n) there is an eval call, so I will start by looking a way of using eval to print out the flag again.
The calls for a method are defined in a table. I will have to try to add to the table a command for resding and then I can call that table row to get the value.

Oh I see that read_variable() is this 
```python 
def read_variable():
  var_name = input('Please enter variable name to read: ')
  if( filter_var_name(var_name) ):
    eval('print('+var_name+')')
  else:
    print('Illegal variable name')
```

So there is another eval call to print the variable name. I need to bypass the filter, so it just needs to be alphanumeric. 

```python
r = re.search('^[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z_0-9]*$', var_name)
```
[Regex Resource](https://regexr.com/)
Looking more into regex shows me that ^ means that it must start with what's in the \[] and \*$shows that it must also end with any number of alpha-numerics.


To call the it I need to write a variable first then I can call it to be read.


The filter_value() method clears out (); so I cannot directly call the win() method

there is an exec call so that can also be used to execute code.
Im looking into how I could bypass the regex check. But do not know how yet.

I checked the hint and it told me to try to modify the function table.

I can see that the function table is a global function so I should be able to modify the table when I write a variable.
I tried changing the func_table so that I can add the win command to the table but the table no longer passes the table check because it needs the length to be 4 * 32. My initial thought is to just type win and then 139 spaces but I feel like there could be a better solution. I cannot modify the table size variable because that also fails the table check. 

At this point I think there is something that I don't know about python so I will peek at the solution. It turns out I have the right idea but what I am doing is not working. I will have to look up what the solution is in a write up.

Nope I was completely wrong. The hint says to look for the func_table and see how we can modify that.
So the solution is to change the value of the a different method in the table and then it will pass the string value of win into the eval call.
This doesn't exactly make sense to me. By shadowing the getRandomNumber method with a variable, it passes the string win into the eval call. Now because of that it calls win, but why does it not call the getRandomNumber still?

I find that most of these solutions make me feel dumb. I need to learn to think about how things can be abused more and be more creative with my problem solving.
