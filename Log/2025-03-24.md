###  [Picker III](https://play.picoctf.org/playlists/2?m=40)
Similar to Picker II, I have to find the way to print the flag from this program.

Opening the file and reading I can see the following methods:
```python
def reset_table()
def check_table()
def get_func(n)
def print_table()
def filter_var_name(var_name)
def read_variable()
def filter_value(value)
def call_func(n)
def dummy_func1()
def dummy_func2()
def dummy_func3()
def dummy_func4()
def getRandomNumner()
def win()
def help_text()
```

I see that within call_func(n) there is an eval call, so I will start by looking a way of using eval to print out the flag again.
The calls for a method are defined in a table. I will have to try to add to the table a command for resding and then I can call that table row to get the value.

Oh I see that read_variable() is this 
```python 
def read_variable():
  var_name = input('Please enter variable name to read: ')
  if( filter_var_name(var_name) ):
    eval('print('+var_name+')')
  else:
    print('Illegal variable name')
```

So there is another eval call to print the variable name. I need to bypass the filter, so it just needs to be alphanumeric. 

To call the it i need to write a variable first then I can call it to be read

The filter_value method clears out (); so I cannot directly call the win() method

there is an exec call so that can also be used to execute code.
