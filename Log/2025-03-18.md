whooping cough.

boot.dev
Docker:
	Learning about networks still. 
	By providing a name to our two running containers and connecting them to our network we are able to access them through the curl command via their name.
	using this command 
		```docker run --network caddytest --name caddy1 -v $PWD/index1.html:/usr/share/caddy/index.html caddy```
	I run a container with the name caddy1 on the caddytest network. This means that I dont have to define any ports.
	Then I use the following command to start the getting-started container as part of the caddytest network. So now when I am in this container I have access to the two other conatiners as they are on the same network. And because they are named I can just used their names as a URI
		```docker run -it --network caddytest docker/getting-started /bin/sh```

Load Balancing:
Allows us to expose only the load balancer and not the application servers and the load balancer with "balance" the traffic depending on what we define in the Caddyfile.
Using Caddy as a load balancer requires setting up a 'Caddyfile' The contents of the provided file are 
```
localhost:80 # defines the host machine port

reverse_proxy caddy1:80 caddy2:80 { # defines the containers that will be part of the load balancing
	lb_policy       round_robin # defines how the load balancer will work
}
```

Then by running:
```
docker run --network caddytest -p 8080:80 -v $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile caddy
```
I set up the network to run another instance of caddy as our loadbalancer since I have our caddy file mounted to do so.
At first it was not sawpping because I had the cached page, so I used a private window that doesnt cache (as much)

Dockerfiles:
	As I learned in school, Docker files define how an image will be built.
```Dockerfile
# This is a comment

# Use a lightweight debian os
# as the base image
FROM debian:stable-slim # Define what BASE image will be used

# execute the 'echo "hello world"'
# command when the container runs
CMD ["echo", "hello world"]	# Defines the entry command that happens when running
```
