Desc: This [.tar file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/52084b5ad360b25f9af83933114324e0/1000.tar) got tarred a lot.
Hypothesis: I have to write a script that will keep untarring the file until it no longer is a tarball.

The following is the script that I have written for untaring a file and it would do all the tarballs in a folder but it doesn't for this since there is only one tarball. 
The next step is repeating the function as long as there is a file with the extension  .tar.  in Pseudocode it would basically be 
```pseudo
while file with .tar ext:
	untar && remove tarball
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in *.tar; do
  tar xvf "${file}" &&
    rm "${file}"
done
```

Below is the script that I ended up with that worked BUT it doesnt stop... I might have just put while true. I assumed that \*.tar would return a non-zero status code if it did not find a tarball and then exit the loop.
It's a png though so I have to get it off my linux machine into my mac

```bash
while [[ *.tar ]]; do
  for file in *.tar; do
    tar xvf "${file}" &&
      rm "${file}"
  done
done
```

I used [[Commands#scp]] and to copy the file to my laptop 
`picoCTF{l0t5_Of_TAR5}`

Desc: Sometimes you need to handle process data outside of a file. Can you find a way to keep the output from this program and search for the flag? Connect to `jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 14291`.

Hypothesis: I have to pipe the output of the `nc` to a file to save and process later.

When connecting to the challenge it prints out a long text that I will most likely have to grep for the flag.
