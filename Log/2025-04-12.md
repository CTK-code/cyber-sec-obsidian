Desc: This [.tar file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/52084b5ad360b25f9af83933114324e0/1000.tar) got tarred a lot.
Hypothesis: I have to write a script that will keep untarring the file until it no longer is a tarball.

The following is the script that I have written for untaring a file and it would do all the tarballs in a folder but it doesn't for this since there is only one tarball. 
The next step is repeating the function as long as there is a file with the extension  .tar.  in Pseudocode it would basically be 
```pseudo
while file with .tar ext:
	untar && remove tarball
```
```bash
#!/bin/bash

for file in *.tar; do
  tar xvf "${file}" &&
    rm "${file}"
done
```

Below is the script that I ended up with that worked BUT it doesnt stop... I might have just put while true. I assumed that \*.tar would return a non-zero status code if it did not find a tarball and then exit the loop.
It's a png though so I have to get it off my linux machine into my mac

```bash
while [[ *.tar ]]; do
  for file in *.tar; do
    tar xvf "${file}" &&
      rm "${file}"
  done
done
```

I used [[Commands#scp]] and to copy the file to my laptop 
`picoCTF{l0t5_Of_TAR5}`

Desc: Sometimes you need to handle process data outside of a file. Can you find a way to keep the output from this program and search for the flag? Connect to `jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 14291`.

Hypothesis: I have to pipe the output of the `nc` to a file to save and process later.

When connecting to the challenge it prints out a long text that I will most likely have to grep for the flag.

`nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 14291 | grep pico` grabbed the flag for me right away.

Desc: There's a flag shop selling stuff, can you buy a flag?

Hypothesis: Code tracing to figure out the input that I will need to print the flag.

This code block tells me what the "win" condition is for this flag. 
Having an account balance of 100001+ will get me the flag when I buy the 1337 flag.

```c
else if(auction_choice == 2){
                printf("1337 flags cost 100000 dollars, and we only have 1 in stock\n");
                printf("Enter 1 to buy one");
                int bid = 0;
                fflush(stdin);
                scanf("%d", &bid);
                
                if(bid == 1){
                    
                    if(account_balance > 100000){
                        FILE *f = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
                        if(f == NULL){

                            printf("flag not found: please run this on the server\n");
                            exit(0);
                        }
                        char buf[64];
                        fgets(buf, 63, f);
                        printf("YOUR FLAG IS: %s\n", buf);
                        }

```

Looking at the program, I can't submit negative numbers to try to add funds, but maybe I can add a huge value and underflow the input

![[flag_store_overflow.png]]I looked up the max value an int can store and then passed it in and it overflows and give me the equivalent of -1 flags.
Any value < the max value of an int would be the negative difference between the two. 
By using `2147480000` I was able to get more than enough money to get the flag.
I purchased the flag and it worked well.
