Cryptography
Desc: This service provides you an encrypted flag. Can you decrypt it with just N & e?
Hypothesis: There is a flag that is somehow encoded with just N and e there is a way to figure out what it means somehow....

I have no idea how to go about this.
Im not sure:
- What get_primes returns
- What inverse does
I will have to look up a write up as I have no idea where to even start.
I do not understand the math required for this. I will instead try to do other problems and hope that I can figure this out later when I come back to it.

Desc: Lyrics jump from verses to the refrain kind of like a subroutine call. There's a hidden refrain this program doesn't print by default. Can you get it to print it? There might be something in it for you.
