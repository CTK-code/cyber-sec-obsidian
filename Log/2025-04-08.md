Cryptography
Desc: This service provides you an encrypted flag. Can you decrypt it with just N & e?
Hypothesis: There is a flag that is somehow encoded with just N and e there is a way to figure out what it means somehow....

I have no idea how to go about this.
Im not sure:
- What get_primes returns
- What inverse does
I will have to look up a write up as I have no idea where to even start.
I do not understand the math required for this. I will instead try to do other problems and hope that I can figure this out later when I come back to it.

Reverse Engineering
Desc: Lyrics jump from verses to the refrain kind of like a subroutine call. There's a hidden refrain this program doesn't print by default. Can you get it to print it? There might be something in it for you.
Hypothesis: Accidentally peaked before writing this. I have to get the flag that is encoded from a set of lyrics was my initial guess.

It's printing a song and lets me input something as a crowd member.

I tried using Refrain and Return to see if it would cause it to loop somewhere but it does nothing.

I found this write up of a different problem discussing the potential abuse cases for input:
https://sevenlayers.com/index.php/215-abusing-python-input

I try not to read these right away and instead read them as I get stuck, so I saw that he tried to inject code using echo so I can try that as well.
when I passed `echo "import sys; print('test');` it put print test on a newline. To me this means that it is processing the ; at some point and I just have to figure out where and how to make it process other things.

Or not it actually no longer prints the whole song now that there are new lines being added. Time to add a bunch of `;` and see what happens
Inputting just a bunch of `;` without any characters between did not create new lines. I will try again with `a;b;c;...` to see if there are breaks. Otherwise I will try the alphabet with quotes surrounding it.

It doesnt seem like this was particularly useful, but it is still splitting it.

I think I just ctrl+c and thats why it didnt print the whole thing before. Ahh but now I think I can use the Refrain jumps or whatever they are.

By Inputting \[RETURN 0] it now is stuck in an infinite loop constantly repeating the first line. It finished after 100 lines since that is the max it can be. Seems like any input is making it repeat the first verse

`a;b;c;END;` actually causes it to end.
Got it.
`a;b;c;RETURN 0;` was the solution. I guess it needed to have more lines before I would execute properly.

Web Exploitation
Desc: A developer has added profile picture upload functionality to a website. However, the implementation is flawed, and it presents an opportunity for you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate to the provided web page and locate the file upload area. Your ultimate goal is to find the hidden flag located in the `/root` directory.
Hypothesis: There will be a way to see where the image is being uploaded in the request and I can manipulate that possibly using burpsuite to change where stuff gets sent to and where I can read from.

Uploading an image lets me access it at `uploads/buildings.png` where buildings.png is the image I uploaded. I will look at /uploads/ to see if that lets me navigate the webpage.
I did not have access to /uploads/ but perhaps the permisisons are stored in the cookies and I can manipulate those.

The hint says that File Upload is not sanitized. Does that mean I can upload other types of files?
I was able to upload a pcap so I guess anything goes. I assume this means I should be trying to send a script. I'll upload a simple bash script and see if I can get it to echo anything.

I can't but I can try to call the file .. or something similar to see if I can move around

I found an article that discusses the way to open a webshell in a php server.
`<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>` allows us to query the path for the commands we want using a GET request.
