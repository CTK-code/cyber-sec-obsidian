Easy
Cryptography
Desc: This service provides you an encrypted flag. Can you decrypt it with just N & e?
Hypothesis: There is a flag that is somehow encoded with just N and e there is a way to figure out what it means somehow....

I have no idea how to go about this.
Im not sure:
- What get_primes returns
- What inverse does
I will have to look up a write up as I have no idea where to even start.
I do not understand the math required for this. I will instead try to do other problems and hope that I can figure this out later when I come back to it.

##### [Flag Hunters]()
Easy
Reverse Engineering
Desc: Lyrics jump from verses to the refrain kind of like a subroutine call. There's a hidden refrain this program doesn't print by default. Can you get it to print it? There might be something in it for you.
Hypothesis: Accidentally peaked before writing this. I have to get the flag that is encoded from a set of lyrics was my initial guess.

It's printing a song and lets me input something as a crowd member.

I tried using Refrain and Return to see if it would cause it to loop somewhere but it does nothing.

I found this write up of a different problem discussing the potential abuse cases for input:
https://sevenlayers.com/index.php/215-abusing-python-input

I try not to read these right away and instead read them as I get stuck, so I saw that he tried to inject code using echo so I can try that as well.
when I passed `echo "import sys; print('test');` it put print test on a newline. To me this means that it is processing the ; at some point and I just have to figure out where and how to make it process other things.

Or not it actually no longer prints the whole song now that there are new lines being added. Time to add a bunch of `;` and see what happens
Inputting just a bunch of `;` without any characters between did not create new lines. I will try again with `a;b;c;...` to see if there are breaks. Otherwise I will try the alphabet with quotes surrounding it.

It doesnt seem like this was particularly useful, but it is still splitting it.

I think I just ctrl+c and thats why it didnt print the whole thing before. Ahh but now I think I can use the Refrain jumps or whatever they are.

By Inputting \[RETURN 0] it now is stuck in an infinite loop constantly repeating the first line. It finished after 100 lines since that is the max it can be. Seems like any input is making it repeat the first verse

`a;b;c;END;` actually causes it to end.
Got it.
`a;b;c;RETURN 0;` was the solution. I guess it needed to have more lines before I would execute properly.

Easy
Web Exploitation
Desc: A developer has added profile picture upload functionality to a website. However, the implementation is flawed, and it presents an opportunity for you. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to navigate to the provided web page and locate the file upload area. Your ultimate goal is to find the hidden flag located in the `/root` directory.
Hypothesis: There will be a way to see where the image is being uploaded in the request and I can manipulate that possibly using burpsuite to change where stuff gets sent to and where I can read from.

Uploading an image lets me access it at `uploads/buildings.png` where buildings.png is the image I uploaded. I will look at /uploads/ to see if that lets me navigate the webpage.
I did not have access to /uploads/ but perhaps the permisisons are stored in the cookies and I can manipulate those.

The hint says that File Upload is not sanitized. Does that mean I can upload other types of files?
I was able to upload a pcap so I guess anything goes. I assume this means I should be trying to send a script. I'll upload a simple bash script and see if I can get it to echo anything.

I can't but I can try to call the file .. or something similar to see if I can move around

I found an article that discusses the way to open a webshell in a php server.
`<?php echo system($_GET['command']); ?>` allows us to query the path for the commands we want using a GET request.

My problem came from the fact that I must have messed up passing inputs to the command so I thought I had to do something else. When I tried again it just let me.

My main misunderstanding came from thinking that the root directory was / and not /root.

So I noticed that parts of the flag are "solved" when I put them through a caeser cypher decrypter.
We can see that picoCTF is spelled but how it becomes the flag will take me a little bit.
`pohzCZK{m311a50_0x_a1rn3x3_h1ah3x6kp60egf}`
`jibtWTE{g311u50_0r_u1lh3r3_b1ub3r6ej60yaz}`
`kjcuXUF{h311v50_0s_v1mi3s3_c1vc3s6fk60zba}`
`edwoROZ{b311p50_0m_p1gc3m3_w1pw3m6ze60tvu}`
picoCTF{b311a50_0r_v1gn3r3_c1ph3r6fe60eaa}
So the letters were all being shifted but the numbers were not so I went through each of the caesar decryptions and worked through them diagonally.

Cryptography
Desc: Sometimes RSA [certificates](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/c882787a19ed5d627eea50f318d87ac5/cert) are breakable.
Hypothesis: Inside the certificate there is a flag encoded somewhere. Or I need to learn how to handle RSA certificates manually.

With the certificate downloaded I have no idea how I could possibly progress. As I do not have a strong enough understanding of how RSA works I will use [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14Q3_5VxqoQ) write up to follow along and write notes.

After each step I will pause the walk through and try to figure out the next steps on my own.

Follow Along Steps:
1) `openssl x509 -pubkey -in cert -out cert.pub`
	- Gets the public key from the certificate.
		- From here I will look into how I can get the p and q from a public key.
2)  `openssl rsa -pubin -in cert.pub -text`
	-  Gets the modulus and the e value 
		- From what I understand, I can get the p and q values by getting the factors of the modulus
3) using [factor calculator](https://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM) I found the factors of the modulus and then used those as the p,q values in the flag.

Ultimately I do not understand why or how this worked but I know that it did, and I do not know how to make this go further to exploit it further.

Web Exploitation
Desc: This website can be rendered only by **picobrowser**, go and catch the flag!
Hypothesis: I will have to change the headers in my request so that it says that it is coming from picobrowser instead of from firefox
Using BurpSuite I could see my request and then send it to the repeater. Then I changed the User-Agent header from Mozilla to `picobrowser` and I saw the flag in the html response

Desc: This vault uses some complicated arrays! I hope you can make sense of it, special agent. The source code for this vault is here: [VaultDoor1.java](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/87e103a8db01087de9ccf5a7a022ddf8/VaultDoor1.java)
Hypothesis: It will. be looking through the arrays and seeing what they print and how I can get them to print the flag.

There was a method that checked the password character by character and it had to be descrabmled in order to see the flag.
Note: I was able to use two separate vim macros to make it much faster which feels really cool.

Hypothesis: I have to find something that is encoded that represents the flag.


I understand why this challenge has a 30% thumbs up score I'll come back to it later

Hypothesis: I have to look through the metadata using exiftool to find the flag.
1) `file pico_img.png`
	- Shows that it is in fact a png
2) `exiftool pico_img.png`
	- Revealed the flag in the author field

Desc: There is a website running at `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/39720/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/39720/)) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:39720. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!
Hypothesis: There will be a complex name that I will have to look either in the code or in the cookies to find and log in.

There is a login page so I open it in the burpsuite browser to see what is being sent and noticed this as part of the data being sent
![[irish-name-repo-1.png]]When I changed the debug value to `debug=1` and sent it again in the repeater it prints out an SQL query
![[irish-name-repo-1-sql.png]]I will then try using SQL injection. 
I had trouble figuring out how to do SQL injection so I found this [cheat sheet](https://www.invicti.com/blog/web-security/sql-injection-cheat-sheet/#StringOperations) and it reminded me how to use comments in SQL so by commenting out the end and I was able to grab the admin user itself
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' --' AND passowrd=''`
The -- comments out the rest of the line that checks for the password which means I can just select for admin with no checks at all.
