Still no idea how the flow works for Auth.

Example of oAuth in a Go/React app.

Maybe?

Cryptography

Desc:
Can you decrypt this message? Decrypt this [message](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/160/cipher.txt) using this key "CYLAB".

Steps:
1) `rgnoDVD{O0NU_WQ3_G1G3O3T3_A1AH3S_2951c89f}`
	- DVD should be CTF so there is a different rule than a 1-1 translation.
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher
2)  Used a translator to figure this out. 
	- Each time the letter will be shifted by the value of the key repeated when the key is completed.

Can you get the flag? Reverse engineer this [binary](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/204/unpackme-upx).

Steps:
1) The file is a linux executable:
	`ELF 64-bit LSB executable` so I need to find out how to read this because `gdb` doesn't work for this.
2) `upx` is a type of packing for executables and binaries to reduce the size of the file. 
	`upx -d unpackme-upx -o unpackedme-upx` is used to unpack the file into the output file.
3) `gdb unpackedme-upx` -> `info functions` to see all of the functions
4) `disassemble main` shows me the assembly of the main function. Knowing that there is a comparison I look for a `cmp` instructions and find it `   0x0000000000401ec8 <+133>: cmp    $0xb83cb,%eax` and translate the hex value to decimal as the answer.
5) Inputting the value 754635 as the answer and it reveals the flag

Can you get the flag? Reverse engineer this [Python program](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/48/unpackme.flag.py).

1) Opening the python file shows a line that looks like a base64 encoded string (because of the == at the end)
		This did not work, might not be encoded.
	
```python
import base64
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet


payload = b"gAAAAABkzWGO_8MlYpNM0n0o718LL-w9m3rzXvCMRFghMRl6CSZwRD5DJOvN_jc8TFHmHmfiI8HWSu49MyoYKvb5mOGm_Jn4kkhC5fuRiGgmwEpxjh0z72dpi6TaPO2TorksAd2bNLemfTaYPf9qiTn_z9mvCQYV9cFKK9m1SqCSr4qDwHXgkQpm7IJAmtEJqyVUfteFLszyxv5-KXJin5BWf9aDPIskp4AztjsBH1_q9e5FIwIq48H7AaHmR8bdvjcW_ZrvhAIOInm1oM-8DjamKvhh7u3-lA=="

key_str = "correctstaplecorrectstaplecorrec"
key_base64 = base64.b64encode(key_str.encode())
f = Fernet(key_base64)
plain = f.decrypt(payload)
exec(plain.decode())
```

2) By adding a print statement `print(plain)` it prints out the encoded python file which shows the flag.

Can you open this safe? I forgot the key to my safe but this [program](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/83/SafeOpener.java) is supposed to help me with retrieving the lost key. Can you help me unlock my safe? Put the password you recover into the picoCTF flag format like: `picoCTF{password}`

Steps:
1) Within the Java file there is a base64 encoded string that was the flag.
