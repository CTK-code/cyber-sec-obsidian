Still no idea how the flow works for Auth.

Example of oAuth in a Go/React app.

Maybe?

Cryptography

Desc:
Can you decrypt this message? Decrypt this [message](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/160/cipher.txt) using this key "CYLAB".

Steps:
1) `rgnoDVD{O0NU_WQ3_G1G3O3T3_A1AH3S_2951c89f}`
	- DVD should be CTF so there is a different rule than a 1-1 translation.
	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher
2)  Used a translator to figure this out. 
	- Each time the letter will be shifted by the value of the key repeated when the key is completed.

Reverse Engineering

Desc:
Can you get the flag? Reverse engineer this [binary](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/204/unpackme-upx).

Steps:
1) The file is a linux executable:
	`ELF 64-bit LSB executable` so I need to find out how to read this because `gdb` doesn't work for this.
2) `upx` is a type of packing for executables and binaries to reduce the size of the file. 
	`upx -d unpackme-upx -o unpackedme-upx` is used to unpack the file into the output file.
3)
